In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book\\ngot it’s name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the\\ntask of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life - or not. He suggested that good and successful people\\nall possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed that we should get better at identifying what\\nthese are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle\\nzeroed in on 11 virtues Courage\\nFriendliness Modesty Aristotle also observed that every virtue\\nseems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’\\n[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between two extremes of character.\\nFor example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:\\nwit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle looks at ways people are better or worse at\\nconversation. (knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the ingredients of\\nthe good life, Aristotle recognised). Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle\\nsense of humour: that’s the “boor”, someone “useless for any kind of social\\nintercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything.’ But others carry humour to excess: ‘The\\nbuffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself, nor anybody else provided that he\\ncan raise a laugh, and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying.’ So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden\\nmean in this area: witty, but tactful. A particularly fascinating moment is when\\nAristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’ ‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around\\nthe whole host of virtues. We can’t change our behaviour in any of\\nthese areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’\\nsays Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’. It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,\\nAristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.\\nWhat they need is not scolding or being thrown in prison but better teachers, more guidance.

The task of art\\n- as Aristotle saw it - is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.\\nThree: What are friends for? In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean\\nEthics Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship.\\nThere’s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun; their ‘chief\\ninterest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment’ which the other\\nperson provides. We need other people to have a nice time around. We need pleasant companions. [on screen, beer drinking festival]\\nThen there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances: ‘they take pleasure\\nin each other’s company only in so far as they have hopes of advantage of it.’ [on screen: faux-jovial business meeting]\\nThen there’s the true friend: Not someone who’s just like you. But someone who isn’t\\nyou - but about whom you care as much as you are about yourself.\\nThe sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows to, their joys are yours. It makes you more\\nvulnerable - should anything befall this person. But it is hugely strengthening: you are relieved\\nfrom the too small orbit of your own thoughts and worries, you expand into the life of another,\\ntogether you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair minded. You share virtues\\nand cancel out each other’s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be. It is - quite\\nliterally - the best part of life. Four: how can ideas cut through in a busy\\nworld? Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck\\nby the fact that the best argument doesn’t always win the debate or the battle. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations:\\nin Athens lots of decisions were made in public meetings (often in the Agora - the town square);\\norators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion. Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals\\nare influenced by many factors that don’t strictly engage with logic or the facts of\\nthe case. It’s maddening. And many serious people\\n[especially Plato] can’t stand it. They avoid the marketplace and populist debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented\\nthe art of what we still today call Rhetoric: the art of getting people to agree with you.\\nHe wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive - to\\nreach those who don’t agree already. He makes some timeless points: You have to\\nrecognise, acknowledge and sooth people’s fears. You have to see the emotional side\\nof the issue - is someone’s pride on the line, are they feeling embarrassed - and edge\\nround it accordingly. You have to make it funny - because attention\\nspans are short. And you might have to use illustrations and\\nexamples to make your point come alive. We’re keen students of Aristotle.\\nToday ‘Philosophy’ doesn’t sound like the most practical activity. Maybe that’s\\nbecause we’ve not paid enough attention, recently, to Aristotle', \"Title: PHILOSOPHY - The Stoics this is a film about ism and why you need your life because as people seldom tell you but we will quietly stoicism was a philosophy that flourished for 480 years in ancient Greece and Rome and was popular with everyone from slaves to the aristocracy because unlike so much philosophy it was helpful helping when we panic want to give up despair and rage at existence we still honor this philosophy whenever we think of someone as brave and without perhaps quite knowing why call them stoic there are two great philosophers of stoicism the first is the Roman writer and Tudor to Nero seneca he lived between 84 and 80 65 that's right Tudor to Nero the infamous dictator who slept with his own mother raped young boys and just because he felt like it asked his old tutor Seneca to commit suicide in front of his own family and our other guy - stoicism is the kind and magnanimous Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius 81 to 1 to 180 who was forced to spend most of his reign on the edges of the Empire fighting off invincible Germanic hordes but found time to write one of the greatest works of philosophy the meditations in his tent at night there are two problems stoicism can help us with in particular the first is anxiety when you're feeling anxious about something most people are maddening they believe it's their duty to cheer you up however intelligent they might otherwise be say things like it'll be okay don't worry even cheer up the Stoics were appalled they hated any kind of consolation that aims to give the listener hope hope is the opium of the emotions and must be stamped out conclusively for a person to stand any chance of inner peace but this hope only lifts you up higher for the eventual fall the Stoics advises to take a different path to be calm one has to tell oneself something very dark it will be terrible I might have to go to prison the lump really could be malign I probably will be fired and humiliated my friends almost certainly will succeed but a huge consoling stoic but one must keep in mind that one will nevertheless be ok ok because in the end as Marcus Aurelius said we are each of us stronger than we think prison won't be fun nor will losing one's job or being made a laughingstock but one will get through it stoicism emboldened us against the worst fate can throw at us and if you really really can't take it suicide is always an option the Stoics mentioned this repeatedly here is Seneca can you no longer see a road of freedom it's right in front of you you need only turn over your wrists to build up an impression of one's own resilience the stoic suggested one regularly rehearse worst-case scenarios for example twice a year one should take off on smart clothes get into some dirty rags sleep on a rug in the kitchen floor and eat only stale bread and rainwater from an animal's Bowl and thereby you'll make an amazing discovery as Marcus Aurelius booted almost nothing material is needed for a happy life for he who has understood existence another subject of interest to the Stoics was anger Romans were a bad-tempered lot the stoics wanted to calm them down but they did so by an unusual route by intellectual argument they proposed that getting angry isn't something you do by nature because you have a Latin temper or a somehow inherently hot-blooded it's the result of being stupid of having the wrong ideas about life anger stems when misplaced hope smashes into unforeseen reality we don't shout every time something bad happens to us only when it's bad and unexpected for example you'd never shout just because it started raining even though rain can be horrible because you've learned to expect rain the same should apply to everything don't only expect rain expect betrayal infamy sadism theft humiliation lust greed spite one will stop being so angry when one learns the true facts of the misery of life the wise person should aim to reach a state where simply nothing could suddenly disturb their peace of mind every tragedy should already be priced in we're gonna leave you with the most beautiful remark that Seneca made just as Nero's guards were grabbing him and shoving into a bathroom where he was meant to take a sharp knife and kill himself his wife Polina and two children were panicking weeping clinging to his cloaks the Seneca turned to them pulled a weary smile at them and simply said what need is there to weep over parts of life the whole of it calls for tears we have much to learn from the Stoics you\", 'Title: PHILOSOPHY - Baruch Spinoza Baruch Spinoza was a 17th century Dutch philosopher who\\ntried to reinvent religion, moving it away from something\\nbased on superstition and ideas of direct divine\\nintervention to being a discipline that was going to be far more impersonal,\\nquasi scientific and yet also at times serenely consoling. Baruch - the word means blessed in\\nHebrew, was born in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam\\nin 1632, a thriving central Jewish commerce in\\nthought. His ancestors were sephardic Jews who\\'d fled the Spanish Peninsula\\nfollowing the Catholic conspired expulsion of 1492 Baruch, a studious, highly\\nintelligent child, received an intensely traditional Jewish education. He went to the local Jewish school, the\\nYeshiva and followed all the Jewish High Holidays and rituals But gradually he began to distance\\nhimself from the faith of his ancestors. \"Although I have been educated from\\nboyhood in  the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture\", he later wrote with characteristic\\ncaution, \"I have felt bound in the end to embrace other views\". His\\nfully fleshed-out views would to be expressed his great work \\'The\\nEthics\\', written entirely in Latin and published in 1677. In The Ethics\\nSpinoza directly challenged the main tenets of Judaism in particular and organized religion in general. God is\\nnot a person who stands outside of nature there is no one to hear our prayers or\\nto create miracles or to punish us for misdeeds. There is no\\nafterlife man is not God\\'s chosen creature. The\\nBible was only written by ordinary people. God is not a craftsman or\\nan architect, nor is he a King or military strategist who calls\\nfor believers to take up the Holy Sword. God doesn\\'t see anything, nor does he expect anything. He doesn\\'t judge. He doesn\\'t even reward the virtuous with the life after death. Every representation of God as a\\nperson is a projection of the imagination and everything in the traditional\\nliturgical calendar is pure superstition and mumbo-jumbo. However, despite all this, remarkably,\\nSpinoza did not declare himself an atheist He insisted that he remained a staunch\\ndefender of God. God plays an absolutely central role\\nin Spinoza\\'s ethics. But it isn\\'t anything like the God who\\nhaunts the pages of the Old Testament. Spinoza\\'s God is wholly impersonal and\\nindistinguishable from what we might variously called \\'nature\\' or \\'existence\\' or a \\'world soul\\'. God is the universe and its laws God is reason and truth. God is the\\nanimating force in everything that is and can be. He is not\\nin time and he cannot be individuated.\\nSpinoza writes: \"Whatever is, is in God and nothing\\ncan exist or be conceived without God.\" Throughout his text, Spinoza was keen to\\nundermine the idea of prayer. In prayer, an individual appeals\\nto God to change the way the universe works. But\\nSpinoza argues that this is entirely the wrong\\nway around. The task of human beings is to try to understand how and why the\\nuniverse works the way it does and then accept it, rather than protest\\nat the workings of existence by sending little messages up into the\\nsky. As Spinoza put it beautifully but rather caustically: \"Whoever loves God cannot strive\\nthat God should love him in return\". In other words\\nonly a deeply distorted and infantile narcissism would lead someone\\nthat wants to believe in God and then to imagine that this God\\nwould take an interest in bending the rules of existence to improve his or her life in some way.\\nSpinoza was deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Stoics of ancient\\nGreece and Rome. They had argued the wisdom lies not in\\nprotest against how things are but in continuous attempts to understand\\nthe ways of the world and then bow down peacefully to\\nnecessity Seneca, Spinoza\\'s favorite philosopher, had\\ncompared human beings to dogs on a leash being led by the necessities of life in\\na range of directions. The more one pulls against what\\'s\\nnecessary, the more one is strangled. And therefore the wise must always\\nendeavor, to try to understand ahead of time how things are. For example what love is like or how\\npolitics works. And then change their direction\\naccordingly so as not to be strangled unnecessarily. It is this kind of stoic attitude that\\nconstantly pervades Spinoza\\'s philosophy. To understand God, traditionally means\\nstudying the Bible and other holy texts. But Spinoza now introduces another idea. The best way to know God is to understand how life and the\\nuniverse work. It\\'s through a knowledge of psychology, philosophy and the natural\\nsciences that one comes to understand God. In traditional religion believers ask special favors of God. Spinoza proposes instead that we should understand what God wants\\nand we can do so in one way above all - by studying everything that is. By\\nreasoning we can exceed to a divine eternal\\nperspective. Spinoza made a famous distinction\\nbetween two ways of looking at life.   We can either see it egoistically from our\\nlimited point of view. As he put it: sub specie durationis (under the aspect of time) or we can look at things globally\\nand eternally: sub specie aeternitatis (under the\\naspect of eternity). Our nature means that we\\'ll always be\\ndivided between the two. Sensual life pulls us towards a time-bound\\npartial view. But our reason and intelligence can give us\\nunique access to another perspective. It can quite literally allow us - and\\nhere Spinoza becomes beautifully lyrical - to participate in eternal totality. Normally we call bad, whatever is bad\\nfor us, and good whatever increases our power and\\nadvantage. But for Spinoza, to be truly ethical means rising above\\nsuch local concerns. It might all sound forbidding, but\\nSpinoza envisaged his philosophy as a route to a life based on freedom\\nfrom guilt, from sorrow, from pity or from shame. Happiness involves aligning our will with\\nthat of the universe. The Universe God has its own projects\\nand it\\'s our task to understand rather than rail against\\nthese. The free person is one conscious of the\\nnecessities that compel us all. Spinoza writes, the wise man, the person\\nwho understands how and why things are, possesses eternally true complacency\\nof spirit. Needless to say these ideas got Spinoza\\ninto a very deep trouble. He was excommunicated\\nfrom the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1656 The rabbis issued a censure known as \\'cherem\\' against the philosopher. It went by the\\ndecree of the angels and by the commander of the holy man - \\nwe excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Brauch Spinoza with all the\\ncurses which are written in the book of law cursed he be by day and cursed be he\\nby night. Cursed be he when he lies down and cursed be he when he rises up. Spinoza\\nwas forced to flee Amsterdam and eventually settled in The Hague,\\nwhere he lived quietly and peacefully as a lens grinder, and private tutor till his death in 1677.\\nSpinoza\\'s work was largely forgotten down the ages. Hegel took an interest, as did Wittgenstein\\nand several other twentieth century philosophers. But from many perspectives Spinoza\\'s\\nwork constitutes a warning about failures of philosophy. The ethics\\nis one of the world\\'s most beautiful books. It contains a calming perspective for\\nstoring take on life. It replaces the God of superstition with\\na wise and consoling pantheism. And yet Spinoza\\'s work failed utterly to\\nconvince any but a few to abandon traditional religion and to\\nmove towards a rationalist, wise system of belief. The reasons are in a way simple and banal. Spinoza failed to\\nunderstand, like so many philosophers before and\\nsince, that what leads people to religion isn\\'t just reason, but far more importantly: emotion, belief,\\nfear and tradition. People stick with their beliefs\\nbecause they like the ritual, the communal meals, the yearly traditions, the beautiful\\narchitecture, the music and the lovely language read out in a sinagoge or\\nchurch. Spinoza\\'s Ethics arguably contains a\\nwhole lot more wisdom than the Bible. But because it comes without any of the Bible\\'s\\nsupporting structure it remains a marginal work, studied here\\nand there at universities in the West. What the\\ntraditional religion, that Spinoza thought outmoded in the 1670s, continues to thrive and convince people. If we\\'re ever to replace traditional beliefs, we\\nmust remember just how much religion has helped along by ritual, tradition, art and a desire to\\nbelong. All things that Spinoza, despite its\\ngreat wisdom, ignored it as peril in his bold attempt'], 'titles': ['PHILOSOPHY - Aristotle_captions.txt', 'PHILOSOPHY - The Stoics_captions.txt', 'PHILOSOPHY - Baruch Spinoza_captions.txt']}}>\n",

Baruch - the word means blessed in\\nHebrew, was born in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam\\nin 1632, a thriving central Jewish commerce in\\nthought. His ancestors were sephardic Jews who\\'d fled the Spanish Peninsula\\nfollowing the Catholic conspired expulsion of 1492 Baruch, a studious, highly\\nintelligent child, received an intensely traditional Jewish education. He went to the local Jewish school, the\\nYeshiva and followed all the Jewish High Holidays and rituals But gradually he began to distance\\nhimself from the faith of his ancestors. \"Although I have been educated from\\nboyhood in  the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture\", he later wrote with characteristic\\ncaution, \"I have felt bound in the end to embrace other views\". His\\nfully fleshed-out views would to be expressed his great work \\'The\\nEthics\\', written entirely in Latin and published in 1677. In The Ethics\\nSpinoza directly challenged the main tenets of Judaism in particular and organized religion in general. God is\\nnot a person who stands outside of nature there is no one to hear our prayers or\\nto create miracles or to punish us for misdeeds. There is no\\nafterlife man is not God\\'s chosen creature. The\\nBible was only written by ordinary people. God is not a craftsman or\\nan architect, nor is he a King or military strategist who calls\\nfor believers to take up the Holy Sword. God doesn\\'t see anything, nor does he expect anything. He doesn\\'t judge. He doesn\\'t even reward the virtuous with the life after death. Every representation of God as a\\nperson is a projection of the imagination and everything in the traditional\\nliturgical calendar is pure superstition and mumbo-jumbo. However, despite all this, remarkably,\\nSpinoza did not declare himself an atheist He insisted that he remained a staunch\\ndefender of God. God plays an absolutely central role\\nin Spinoza\\'s ethics. But it isn\\'t anything like the God who\\nhaunts the pages of the Old Testament. Spinoza\\'s God is wholly impersonal and\\nindistinguishable from what we might variously called \\'nature\\' or \\'existence\\' or a \\'world soul\\'. God is the universe and its laws God is reason and truth. God is the\\nanimating force in everything that is and can be. He is not\\nin time and he cannot be individuated.\\nSpinoza writes: \"Whatever is, is in God and nothing\\ncan exist or be conceived without God.\" Throughout his text, Spinoza was keen to\\nundermine the idea of prayer. In prayer, an individual appeals\\nto God to change the way the universe works. But\\nSpinoza argues that this is entirely the wrong\\nway around. The task of human beings is to try to understand how and why the\\nuniverse works the way it does and then accept it, rather than protest\\nat the workings of existence by sending little messages up into the\\nsky. As Spinoza put it beautifully but rather caustically: \"Whoever loves God cannot strive\\nthat God should love him in return\". In other words\\nonly a deeply distorted and infantile narcissism would lead someone\\nthat wants to believe in God and then to imagine that this God\\nwould take an interest in bending the rules of existence to improve his or her life in some way.\\nSpinoza was deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Stoics of ancient\\nGreece and Rome. They had argued the wisdom lies not in\\nprotest against how things are but in continuous attempts to understand\\nthe ways of the world and then bow down peacefully to\\nnecessity Seneca, Spinoza\\'s favorite philosopher, had\\ncompared human beings to dogs on a leash being led by the necessities of life in\\na range of directions. The more one pulls against what\\'s\\nnecessary, the more one is strangled. And therefore the wise must always\\nendeavor, to try to understand ahead of time how things are. For example what love is like or how\\npolitics works. And then change their direction\\naccordingly so as not to be strangled unnecessarily. It is this kind of stoic attitude that\\nconstantly pervades Spinoza\\'s philosophy. To understand God, traditionally means\\nstudying the Bible and other holy texts. But Spinoza now introduces another idea. The best way to know God is to understand how life and the\\nuniverse work. It\\'s through a knowledge of psychology, philosophy and the natural\\nsciences that one comes to understand God. In traditional religion believers ask special favors of God. Spinoza proposes instead that we should understand what God wants\\nand we can do so in one way above all - by studying everything that is. By\\nreasoning we can exceed to a divine eternal\\nperspective. Spinoza made a famous distinction\\nbetween two ways of looking at life.   We can either see it egoistically from our\\nlimited point of view. As he put it: sub specie durationis (under the aspect of time) or we can look at things globally\\nand eternally: sub specie aeternitatis (under the\\naspect of eternity). Our nature means that we\\'ll always be\\ndivided between the two. Sensual life pulls us towards a time-bound\\npartial view. But our reason and intelligence can give us\\nunique access to another perspective. It can quite literally allow us - and\\nhere Spinoza becomes beautifully lyrical - to participate in eternal totality. Normally we call bad, whatever is bad\\nfor us, and good whatever increases our power and\\nadvantage. But for Spinoza, to be truly ethical means rising above\\nsuch local concerns. It might all sound forbidding, but\\nSpinoza envisaged his philosophy as a route to a life based on freedom\\nfrom guilt, from sorrow, from pity or from shame. Happiness involves aligning our will with\\nthat of the universe. The Universe God has its own projects\\nand it\\'s our task to understand rather than rail against\\nthese. The free person is one conscious of the\\nnecessities that compel us all. Spinoza writes, the wise man, the person\\nwho understands how and why things are, possesses eternally true complacency\\nof spirit. Needless to say these ideas got Spinoza\\ninto a very deep trouble. He was excommunicated\\nfrom the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1656 The rabbis issued a censure known as \\'cherem\\' against the philosopher. It went by the\\ndecree of the angels and by the commander of the holy man - \\nwe excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Brauch Spinoza with all the\\ncurses which are written in the book of law cursed he be by day and cursed be he\\nby night. Cursed be he when he lies down and cursed be he when he rises up. Spinoza\\nwas forced to flee Amsterdam and eventually settled in The Hague,\\nwhere he lived quietly and peacefully as a lens grinder, and private tutor till his death in 1677.\\nSpinoza\\'s work was largely forgotten down the ages. Hegel took an interest, as did Wittgenstein\\nand several other twentieth century philosophers. But from many perspectives Spinoza\\'s\\nwork constitutes a warning about failures of philosophy. The ethics\\nis one of the world\\'s most beautiful books. It contains a calming perspective for\\nstoring take on life. It replaces the God of superstition with\\na wise and consoling pantheism. And yet Spinoza\\'s work failed utterly to\\nconvince any but a few to abandon traditional religion and to\\nmove towards a rationalist, wise system of belief. The reasons are in a way simple and banal. Spinoza failed to\\nunderstand, like so many philosophers before and\\nsince, that what leads people to religion isn\\'t just reason, but far more importantly: emotion, belief,\\nfear and tradition. People stick with their beliefs\\nbecause they like the ritual, the communal meals, the yearly traditions, the beautiful\\narchitecture, the music and the lovely language read out in a sinagoge or\\nchurch. Spinoza\\'s Ethics arguably contains a\\nwhole lot more wisdom than the Bible. But because it comes without any of the Bible\\'s\\nsupporting structure it remains a marginal work, studied here\\nand there at universities in the West. What the\\ntraditional religion, that Spinoza thought outmoded in the 1670s, continues to thrive and convince people. If we\\'re ever to replace traditional beliefs, we\\nmust remember just how much religion has helped along by ritual, tradition, art and a desire to\\nbelong.

It is based on the idea that the best way to teach a subject is to present the subject in a way that makes it easy for the audience to understand what you are trying to teach them. For example, if you want to explain why the universe is the way it is, you need to explain the universe in terms that are easy for people to understand. For instance, you might say, \"The universe is made up of atoms.\" This is true, but it is also true that there are atoms in the universe that are not made of atoms, but of molecules that are made of molecules. These molecules are called atoms, and they are what make up the universe. When you ask a question about the universe, you are asking the question, \"What is the universe made of?\" This is a question that can be asked in a variety of ways, but the most common way is to', 'type': 'generative', 'score': None, 'context': None, 'offsets_in_document': None, 'offsets_in_context': None, 'document_id': None, 'meta': {'doc_ids': ['9e9958dbbc050888463b60d181de66a9', '2e77a54f2372b968148afb2c2e4f2899', 'b0d783def7fb569863967f8413691b1c'], 'doc_scores': [0.5410458138118021, 0.54092481947482, 0.5399187649618304], 'content': ['Title: PHILOSOPHY - Aristotle Aristotle was born around 384 BC in the ancient\\nGreek kingdom of Macedonia where his father was the royal doctor.\\nHe grew up to be arguably the most influential philosopher ever, with modest nicknames like\\n‘the master’ and simply ‘the philosopher’. His first big job was tutoring Alexander the\\nGreat who, soon after, went out and conquered the known world Aristotle then headed off to Athens, worked\\nwith Plato for a bit, then branched out on his own. He founded a little school called\\nthe Lyceum. French secondary schools - ‘the lycees’ - are named in honour of this venture.\\nHe liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas. His followers were nicknamed ‘peripatetics’\\n- ‘the wanderers.’ His many books are actually lecture\\nnotes Aristotle was fascinated by how many things actually work: how does a chick grow in an\\negg? How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place and hardly at all in another? And - most\\nimportantly - what makes a human life, and a whole society, go well?\\nFor Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom.\\nHere are four big philosophical questions he answered.\\nOne : what makes people happy? In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book\\ngot it’s name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the\\ntask of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life - or not. He suggested that good and successful people\\nall possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed that we should get better at identifying what\\nthese are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle\\nzeroed in on 11 virtues Courage\\nFriendliness Modesty Aristotle also observed that every virtue\\nseems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’\\n[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between two extremes of character.\\nFor example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:\\nwit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle looks at ways people are better or worse at\\nconversation. (knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the ingredients of\\nthe good life, Aristotle recognised). Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle\\nsense of humour: that’s the “boor”, someone “useless for any kind of social\\nintercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything.’ But others carry humour to excess: ‘The\\nbuffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself, nor anybody else provided that he\\ncan raise a laugh, and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying.’ So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden\\nmean in this area: witty, but tactful. A particularly fascinating moment is when\\nAristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’ ‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around\\nthe whole host of virtues. We can’t change our behaviour in any of\\nthese areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’\\nsays Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’. It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,\\nAristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.\\nWhat they need is not scolding or being thrown in prison but better teachers, more guidance. Two: what is art for? The blockbuster art at that time was tragedy.\\nAthenians watched gory plays at community festivals in huge open air theatres. Aeschylus,\\nEuripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a ‘how to write great plays’\\nmanual: the Poetics. It’s packed with great tips.\\nFor example, make sure to use: peripeteia - a change in fortune, when for\\nthe hero things go from great to awful [in Titanic, Leonardo de Caprio gets Kate Winslow\\n(great) then they hit the iceberg (awful) and\\nanagnoresis - a moment of dramatic revelation when suddenly the hero works out their life\\nis a catastrophe But what is tragedy actually for? What is the point of a whole community coming together\\nto watch horrible things happening to the lead characters? Like Oedipus (in the play\\nby Sophocles) who by accident, kills his father, gets married to his mother, finds out he’s\\ndone these things [on screen: anagnoresis!) and gouges out his own eyes in remorse and\\ndespair. Aristotle’s answer is Katharis - which is\\ngreek for … Catharsis. Catharsis is a kind of cleaning - you get rid of bad stuff. In this case cleaning up\\nour emotions, specifically our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity.\\nWe’ve got natural problems here: we are hard hearted: we don’t give pity where it\\nis deserved. And we’re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough Tragedy reminds us that:\\nterrible things can befall decent people including ourselves): a small flaw can lead to a whole\\nwe should have more compassion (or pity) for those whose actions go disastrously wrong.\\nWe need to be collective re-taught these crucial truths on a regular basis. The task of art\\n- as Aristotle saw it - is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.\\nThree: What are friends for? In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean\\nEthics Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship.\\nThere’s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun; their ‘chief\\ninterest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment’ which the other\\nperson provides. We need other people to have a nice time around. We need pleasant companions. [on screen, beer drinking festival]\\nThen there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances: ‘they take pleasure\\nin each other’s company only in so far as they have hopes of advantage of it.’ [on screen: faux-jovial business meeting]\\nThen there’s the true friend: Not someone who’s just like you. But someone who isn’t\\nyou - but about whom you care as much as you are about yourself.\\nThe sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows to, their joys are yours. It makes you more\\nvulnerable - should anything befall this person. But it is hugely strengthening: you are relieved\\nfrom the too small orbit of your own thoughts and worries, you expand into the life of another,\\ntogether you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair minded. You share virtues\\nand cancel out each other’s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be. It is - quite\\nliterally - the best part of life. Four: how can ideas cut through in a busy\\nworld? Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck\\nby the fact that the best argument doesn’t always win the debate or the battle. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations:\\nin Athens lots of decisions were made in public meetings (often in the Agora - the town square);\\norators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion. Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals\\nare influenced by many factors that don’t strictly engage with logic or the facts of\\nthe case. It’s maddening. And many serious people\\n[especially Plato] can’t stand it. They avoid the marketplace and populist debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented\\nthe art of what we still today call Rhetoric: the art of getting people to agree with you.\\nHe wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive - to\\nreach those who don’t agree already. He makes some timeless points: You have to\\nrecognise, acknowledge and sooth people’s fears. You have to see the emotional side\\nof the issue - is someone’s pride on the line, are they feeling embarrassed - and edge\\nround it accordingly. You have to make it funny - because attention\\nspans are short. And you might have to use illustrations and\\nexamples to make your point come alive. We’re keen students of Aristotle.\\nToday ‘Philosophy’ doesn’t sound like the most practical activity. Maybe that’s\\nbecause we’ve not paid enough attention, recently, to Aristotle', \"Title: PHILOSOPHY - The Stoics this is a film about ism and why you need your life because as people seldom tell you but we will quietly stoicism was a philosophy that flourished for 480 years in ancient Greece and Rome and was popular with everyone from slaves to the aristocracy because unlike so much philosophy it was helpful helping when we panic want to give up despair and rage at existence we still honor this philosophy whenever we think of someone as brave and without perhaps quite knowing why call them stoic there are two great philosophers of stoicism the first is the Roman writer and Tudor to Nero seneca he lived between 84 and 80 65 that's right Tudor to Nero the infamous dictator who slept with his own mother raped young boys and just because he felt like it asked his old tutor Seneca to commit suicide in front of his own family and our other guy - stoicism is the kind and magnanimous Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius 81 to 1 to 180 who was forced to spend most of his reign on the edges of the Empire fighting off invincible Germanic hordes but found time to write one of the greatest works of philosophy the meditations in his tent at night there are two problems stoicism can help us with in particular the first is anxiety when you're feeling anxious about something most people are maddening they believe it's their duty to cheer you up however intelligent they might otherwise be say things like it'll be okay don't worry even cheer up the Stoics were appalled they hated any kind of consolation that aims to give the listener hope hope is the opium of the emotions and must be stamped out conclusively for a person to stand any chance of inner peace but this hope only lifts you up higher for the eventual fall the Stoics advises to take a different path to be calm one has to tell oneself something very dark it will be terrible I might have to go to prison the lump really could be malign I probably will be fired and humiliated my friends almost certainly will succeed but a huge consoling stoic but one must keep in mind that one will nevertheless be ok ok because in the end as Marcus Aurelius said we are each of us stronger than we think prison won't be fun nor will losing one's job or being made a laughingstock but one will get through it stoicism emboldened us against the worst fate can throw at us and if you really really can't take it suicide is always an option the Stoics mentioned this repeatedly here is Seneca can you no longer see a road of freedom it's right in front of you you need only turn over your wrists to build up an impression of one's own resilience the stoic suggested one regularly rehearse worst-case scenarios for example twice a year one should take off on smart clothes get into some dirty rags sleep on a rug in the kitchen floor and eat only stale bread and rainwater from an animal's Bowl and thereby you'll make an amazing discovery as Marcus Aurelius booted almost nothing material is needed for a happy life for he who has understood existence another subject of interest to the Stoics was anger Romans were a bad-tempered lot the stoics wanted to calm them down but they did so by an unusual route by intellectual argument they proposed that getting angry isn't something you do by nature because you have a Latin temper or a somehow inherently hot-blooded it's the result of being stupid of having the wrong ideas about life anger stems when misplaced hope smashes into unforeseen reality we don't shout every time something bad happens to us only when it's bad and unexpected for example you'd never shout just because it started raining even though rain can be horrible because you've learned to expect rain the same should apply to everything don't only expect rain expect betrayal infamy sadism theft humiliation lust greed spite one will stop being so angry when one learns the true facts of the misery of life the wise person should aim to reach a state where simply nothing could suddenly disturb their peace of mind every tragedy should already be priced in we're gonna leave you with the most beautiful remark that Seneca made just as Nero's guards were grabbing him and shoving into a bathroom where he was meant to take a sharp knife and kill himself his wife Polina and two children were panicking weeping clinging to his cloaks the Seneca turned to them pulled a weary smile at them and simply said what need is there to weep over parts of life the whole of it calls for tears we have much to learn from the Stoics you\", 'Title: PHILOSOPHY - Baruch Spinoza Baruch Spinoza was a 17th century Dutch philosopher who\\ntried to reinvent religion, moving it away from something\\nbased on superstition and ideas of direct divine\\nintervention to being a discipline that was going to be far more impersonal,\\nquasi scientific and yet also at times serenely consoling.

How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place and hardly at all in another? And - most\\nimportantly - what makes a human life, and a whole society, go well?\\nFor Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom.\\nHere are four big philosophical questions he answered.\\nOne : what makes people happy? In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book\\ngot it’s name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the\\ntask of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life - or not. He suggested that good and successful people\\nall possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed that we should get better at identifying what\\nthese are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle\\nzeroed in on 11 virtues Courage\\nFriendliness Modesty Aristotle also observed that every virtue\\nseems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’\\n[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between two extremes of character.\\nFor example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:\\nwit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle looks at ways people are better or worse at\\nconversation. (knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the ingredients of\\nthe good life, Aristotle recognised). Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle\\nsense of humour: that’s the “boor”, someone “useless for any kind of social\\nintercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything.’ But others carry humour to excess: ‘The\\nbuffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself, nor anybody else provided that he\\ncan raise a laugh, and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying.’ So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden\\nmean in this area: witty, but tactful. A particularly fascinating moment is when\\nAristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’ ‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around\\nthe whole host of virtues. We can’t change our behaviour in any of\\nthese areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’\\nsays Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’. It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,\\nAristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.\\nWhat they need is not scolding or being thrown in prison but better teachers, more guidance. Two: what is art for? The blockbuster art at that time was tragedy.\\nAthenians watched gory plays at community festivals in huge open air theatres. Aeschylus,\\nEuripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a ‘how to write great plays’\\nmanual: the Poetics.

Aristotle’s answer is Katharis - which is\\ngreek for … Catharsis. Catharsis is a kind of cleaning - you get rid of bad stuff. In this case cleaning up\\nour emotions, specifically our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity.\\nWe’ve got natural problems here: we are hard hearted: we don’t give pity where it\\nis deserved. And we’re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough Tragedy reminds us that:\\nterrible things can befall decent people including ourselves): a small flaw can lead to a whole\\nwe should have more compassion (or pity) for those whose actions go disastrously wrong.\\nWe need to be collective re-taught these crucial truths on a regular basis. The task of art\\n- as Aristotle saw it - is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.\\nThree: What are friends for? In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean\\nEthics Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship.\\nThere’s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun; their ‘chief\\ninterest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment’ which the other\\nperson provides. We need other people to have a nice time around. We need pleasant companions. [on screen, beer drinking festival]\\nThen there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances: ‘they take pleasure\\nin each other’s company only in so far as they have hopes of advantage of it.’ [on screen: faux-jovial business meeting]\\nThen there’s the true friend: Not someone who’s just like you. But someone who isn’t\\nyou - but about whom you care as much as you are about yourself.\\nThe sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows to, their joys are yours. It makes you more\\nvulnerable - should anything befall this person. But it is hugely strengthening: you are relieved\\nfrom the too small orbit of your own thoughts and worries, you expand into the life of another,\\ntogether you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair minded. You share virtues\\nand cancel out each other’s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be. It is - quite\\nliterally - the best part of life. Four: how can ideas cut through in a busy\\nworld? Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck\\nby the fact that the best argument doesn’t always win the debate or the battle. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations:\\nin Athens lots of decisions were made in public meetings (often in the Agora - the town square);\\norators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion. Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals\\nare influenced by many factors that don’t strictly engage with logic or the facts of\\nthe case. It’s maddening. And many serious people\\n[especially Plato] can’t stand it. They avoid the marketplace and populist debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented\\nthe art of what we still today call Rhetoric: the art of getting people to agree with you.\\nHe wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive - to\\nreach those who don’t agree already. He makes some timeless points: You have to\\nrecognise, acknowledge and sooth people’s fears. You have to see the emotional side\\nof the issue - is someone’s pride on the line, are they feeling embarrassed - and edge\\nround it accordingly. You have to make it funny - because attention\\nspans are short. And you might have to use illustrations and\\nexamples to make your point come alive. We’re keen students of Aristotle.\\nToday ‘Philosophy’ doesn’t sound like the most practical activity. Maybe that’s\\nbecause we’ve not paid enough attention, recently, to Aristotle', \"Title: PHILOSOPHY - The Stoics this is a film about ism and why you need your life because as people seldom tell you but we will quietly stoicism was a philosophy that flourished for 480 years in ancient Greece and Rome and was popular with everyone from slaves to the aristocracy because unlike so much philosophy it was helpful helping when we panic want to give up despair and rage at existence we still honor this philosophy whenever we think of someone as brave and without perhaps quite knowing why call them stoic there are two great philosophers of stoicism the first is the Roman writer and Tudor to Nero seneca he lived between 84 and 80 65 that's right Tudor to Nero the infamous dictator who slept with his own mother raped young boys and just because he felt like it asked his old tutor Seneca to commit suicide in front of his own family and our other guy - stoicism is the kind and magnanimous Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius 81 to 1 to 180 who was forced to spend most of his reign on the edges of the Empire fighting off invincible Germanic hordes but found time to write one of the greatest works of philosophy the meditations in his tent at night there are two problems stoicism can help us with in particular the first is anxiety when you're feeling anxious about something most people are maddening they believe it's their duty to cheer you up however intelligent they might otherwise be say things like it'll be okay don't worry even cheer up the Stoics were appalled they hated any kind of consolation that aims to give the listener hope hope is the opium of the emotions and must be stamped out conclusively for a person to stand any chance of inner peace but this hope only lifts you up higher for the eventual fall the Stoics advises to take a different path to be calm one has to tell oneself something very dark it will be terrible I might have to go to prison the lump really could be malign I probably will be fired and humiliated my friends almost certainly will succeed but a huge consoling stoic but one must keep in mind that one will nevertheless be ok ok because in the end as Marcus Aurelius said we are each of us stronger than we think prison won't be fun nor will losing one's job or being made a laughingstock but one will get through it stoicism emboldened us against the worst fate can throw at us and if you really really can't take it suicide is always an option the Stoics mentioned this repeatedly here is Seneca can you no longer see a road of freedom it's right in front of you you need only turn over your wrists to build up an impression of one's own resilience the stoic suggested one regularly rehearse worst-case scenarios for example twice a year one should take off on smart clothes get into some dirty rags sleep on a rug in the kitchen floor and eat only stale bread and rainwater from an animal's Bowl and thereby you'll make an amazing discovery as Marcus Aurelius booted almost nothing material is needed for a happy life for he who has understood existence another subject of interest to the Stoics was anger Romans were a bad-tempered lot the stoics wanted to calm them down but they did so by an unusual route by intellectual argument they proposed that getting angry isn't something you do by nature because you have a Latin temper or a somehow inherently hot-blooded it's the result of being stupid of having the wrong ideas about life anger stems when misplaced hope smashes into unforeseen reality we don't shout every time something bad happens to us only when it's bad and unexpected for example you'd never shout just because it started raining even though rain can be horrible because you've learned to expect rain the same should apply to everything don't only expect rain expect betrayal infamy sadism theft humiliation lust greed spite one will stop being so angry when one learns the true facts of the misery of life the wise person should aim to reach a state where simply nothing could suddenly disturb their peace of mind every tragedy should already be priced in we're gonna leave you with the most beautiful remark that Seneca made just as Nero's guards were grabbing him and shoving into a bathroom where he was meant to take a sharp knife and kill himself his wife Polina and two children were panicking weeping clinging to his cloaks the Seneca turned to them pulled a weary smile at them and simply said what need is there to weep over parts of life the whole of it calls for tears we have much to learn from the Stoics you\", 'Title: PHILOSOPHY - Baruch Spinoza Baruch Spinoza was a 17th century Dutch philosopher who\\ntried to reinvent religion, moving it away from something\\nbased on superstition and ideas of direct divine\\nintervention to being a discipline that was going to be far more impersonal,\\nquasi scientific and yet also at times serenely consoling. Baruch - the word means blessed in\\nHebrew, was born in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam\\nin 1632, a thriving central Jewish commerce in\\nthought. His ancestors were sephardic Jews who\\'d fled the Spanish Peninsula\\nfollowing the Catholic conspired expulsion of 1492 Baruch, a studious, highly\\nintelligent child, received an intensely traditional Jewish education. He went to the local Jewish school, the\\nYeshiva and followed all the Jewish High Holidays and rituals But gradually he began to distance\\nhimself from the faith of his ancestors. \"Although I have been educated from\\nboyhood in  the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture\", he later wrote with characteristic\\ncaution, \"I have felt bound in the end to embrace other views\". His\\nfully fleshed-out views would to be expressed his great work \\'The\\nEthics\\', written entirely in Latin and published in 1677. In The Ethics\\nSpinoza directly challenged the main tenets of Judaism in particular and organized religion in general. God is\\nnot a person who stands outside of nature there is no one to hear our prayers or\\nto create miracles or to punish us for misdeeds. There is no\\nafterlife man is not God\\'s chosen creature. The\\nBible was only written by ordinary people. God is not a craftsman or\\nan architect, nor is he a King or military strategist who calls\\nfor believers to take up the Holy Sword. God doesn\\'t see anything, nor does he expect anything. He doesn\\'t judge. He doesn\\'t even reward the virtuous with the life after death. Every representation of God as a\\nperson is a projection of the imagination and everything in the traditional\\nliturgical calendar is pure superstition and mumbo-jumbo. However, despite all this, remarkably,\\nSpinoza did not declare himself an atheist He insisted that he remained a staunch\\ndefender of God. God plays an absolutely central role\\nin Spinoza\\'s ethics. But it isn\\'t anything like the God who\\nhaunts the pages of the Old Testament. Spinoza\\'s God is wholly impersonal and\\nindistinguishable from what we might variously called \\'nature\\' or \\'existence\\' or a \\'world soul\\'. God is the universe and its laws God is reason and truth. God is the\\nanimating force in everything that is and can be. He is not\\nin time and he cannot be individuated.\\nSpinoza writes: \"Whatever is, is in God and nothing\\ncan exist or be conceived without God.\" Throughout his text, Spinoza was keen to\\nundermine the idea of prayer. In prayer, an individual appeals\\nto God to change the way the universe works. But\\nSpinoza argues that this is entirely the wrong\\nway around. The task of human beings is to try to understand how and why the\\nuniverse works the way it does and then accept it, rather than protest\\nat the workings of existence by sending little messages up into the\\nsky. As Spinoza put it beautifully but rather caustically: \"Whoever loves God cannot strive\\nthat God should love him in return\". In other words\\nonly a deeply distorted and infantile narcissism would lead someone\\nthat wants to believe in God and then to imagine that this God\\nwould take an interest in bending the rules of existence to improve his or her life in some way.\\nSpinoza was deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Stoics of ancient\\nGreece and Rome. They had argued the wisdom lies not in\\nprotest against how things are but in continuous attempts to understand\\nthe ways of the world and then bow down peacefully to\\nnecessity Seneca, Spinoza\\'s favorite philosopher, had\\ncompared human beings to dogs on a leash being led by the necessities of life in\\na range of directions. The more one pulls against what\\'s\\nnecessary, the more one is strangled. And therefore the wise must always\\nendeavor, to try to understand ahead of time how things are. For example what love is like or how\\npolitics works. And then change their direction\\naccordingly so as not to be strangled unnecessarily. It is this kind of stoic attitude that\\nconstantly pervades Spinoza\\'s philosophy. To understand God, traditionally means\\nstudying the Bible and other holy texts. But Spinoza now introduces another idea. The best way to know God is to understand how life and the\\nuniverse work. It\\'s through a knowledge of psychology, philosophy and the natural\\nsciences that one comes to understand God. In traditional religion believers ask special favors of God. Spinoza proposes instead that we should understand what God wants\\nand we can do so in one way above all - by studying everything that is. By\\nreasoning we can exceed to a divine eternal\\nperspective. Spinoza made a famous distinction\\nbetween two ways of looking at life.   We can either see it egoistically from our\\nlimited point of view. As he put it: sub specie durationis (under the aspect of time) or we can look at things globally\\nand eternally: sub specie aeternitatis (under the\\naspect of eternity). Our nature means that we\\'ll always be\\ndivided between the two. Sensual life pulls us towards a time-bound\\npartial view. But our reason and intelligence can give us\\nunique access to another perspective. It can quite literally allow us - and\\nhere Spinoza becomes beautifully lyrical - to participate in eternal totality. Normally we call bad, whatever is bad\\nfor us, and good whatever increases our power and\\nadvantage. But for Spinoza, to be truly ethical means rising above\\nsuch local concerns. It might all sound forbidding, but\\nSpinoza envisaged his philosophy as a route to a life based on freedom\\nfrom guilt, from sorrow, from pity or from shame. Happiness involves aligning our will with\\nthat of the universe. The Universe God has its own projects\\nand it\\'s our task to understand rather than rail against\\nthese. The free person is one conscious of the\\nnecessities that compel us all. Spinoza writes, the wise man, the person\\nwho understands how and why things are, possesses eternally true complacency\\nof spirit. Needless to say these ideas got Spinoza\\ninto a very deep trouble. He was excommunicated\\nfrom the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1656 The rabbis issued a censure known as \\'cherem\\' against the philosopher. It went by the\\ndecree of the angels and by the commander of the holy man - \\nwe excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Brauch Spinoza with all the\\ncurses which are written in the book of law cursed he be by day and cursed be he\\nby night. Cursed be he when he lies down and cursed be he when he rises up. Spinoza\\nwas forced to flee Amsterdam and eventually settled in The Hague,\\nwhere he lived quietly and peacefully as a lens grinder, and private tutor till his death in 1677.\\nSpinoza\\'s work was largely forgotten down the ages. Hegel took an interest, as did Wittgenstein\\nand several other twentieth century philosophers. But from many perspectives Spinoza\\'s\\nwork constitutes a warning about failures of philosophy. The ethics\\nis one of the world\\'s most beautiful books. It contains a calming perspective for\\nstoring take on life. It replaces the God of superstition with\\na wise and consoling pantheism. And yet Spinoza\\'s work failed utterly to\\nconvince any but a few to abandon traditional religion and to\\nmove towards a rationalist, wise system of belief. The reasons are in a way simple and banal. Spinoza failed to\\nunderstand, like so many philosophers before and\\nsince, that what leads people to religion isn\\'t just reason, but far more importantly: emotion, belief,\\nfear and tradition.

Baruch - the word means blessed in\\nHebrew, was born in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam\\nin 1632, a thriving central Jewish commerce in\\nthought. His ancestors were sephardic Jews who\\'d fled the Spanish Peninsula\\nfollowing the Catholic conspired expulsion of 1492 Baruch, a studious, highly\\nintelligent child, received an intensely traditional Jewish education. He went to the local Jewish school, the\\nYeshiva and followed all the Jewish High Holidays and rituals But gradually he began to distance\\nhimself from the faith of his ancestors. \"Although I have been educated from\\nboyhood in  the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture\", he later wrote with characteristic\\ncaution, \"I have felt bound in the end to embrace other views\". His\\nfully fleshed-out views would to be expressed his great work \\'The\\nEthics\\', written entirely in Latin and published in 1677. In The Ethics\\nSpinoza directly challenged the main tenets of Judaism in particular and organized religion in general. God is\\nnot a person who stands outside of nature there is no one to hear our prayers or\\nto create miracles or to punish us for misdeeds. There is no\\nafterlife man is not God\\'s chosen creature. The\\nBible was only written by ordinary people. God is not a craftsman or\\nan architect, nor is he a King or military strategist who calls\\nfor believers to take up the Holy Sword. God doesn\\'t see anything, nor does he expect anything. He doesn\\'t judge. He doesn\\'t even reward the virtuous with the life after death. Every representation of God as a\\nperson is a projection of the imagination and everything in the traditional\\nliturgical calendar is pure superstition and mumbo-jumbo. However, despite all this, remarkably,\\nSpinoza did not declare himself an atheist He insisted that he remained a staunch\\ndefender of God. God plays an absolutely central role\\nin Spinoza\\'s ethics. But it isn\\'t anything like the God who\\nhaunts the pages of the Old Testament. Spinoza\\'s God is wholly impersonal and\\nindistinguishable from what we might variously called \\'nature\\' or \\'existence\\' or a \\'world soul\\'. God is the universe and its laws God is reason and truth. God is the\\nanimating force in everything that is and can be. He is not\\nin time and he cannot be individuated.\\nSpinoza writes: \"Whatever is, is in God and nothing\\ncan exist or be conceived without God.\" Throughout his text, Spinoza was keen to\\nundermine the idea of prayer. In prayer, an individual appeals\\nto God to change the way the universe works. But\\nSpinoza argues that this is entirely the wrong\\nway around. The task of human beings is to try to understand how and why the\\nuniverse works the way it does and then accept it, rather than protest\\nat the workings of existence by sending little messages up into the\\nsky. As Spinoza put it beautifully but rather caustically: \"Whoever loves God cannot strive\\nthat God should love him in return\". In other words\\nonly a deeply distorted and infantile narcissism would lead someone\\nthat wants to believe in God and then to imagine that this God\\nwould take an interest in bending the rules of existence to improve his or her life in some way.\\nSpinoza was deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Stoics of ancient\\nGreece and Rome. They had argued the wisdom lies not in\\nprotest against how things are but in continuous attempts to understand\\nthe ways of the world and then bow down peacefully to\\nnecessity Seneca, Spinoza\\'s favorite philosopher, had\\ncompared human beings to dogs on a leash being led by the necessities of life in\\na range of directions. The more one pulls against what\\'s\\nnecessary, the more one is strangled. And therefore the wise must always\\nendeavor, to try to understand ahead of time how things are. For example what love is like or how\\npolitics works. And then change their direction\\naccordingly so as not to be strangled unnecessarily. It is this kind of stoic attitude that\\nconstantly pervades Spinoza\\'s philosophy. To understand God, traditionally means\\nstudying the Bible and other holy texts. But Spinoza now introduces another idea. The best way to know God is to understand how life and the\\nuniverse work. It\\'s through a knowledge of psychology, philosophy and the natural\\nsciences that one comes to understand God. In traditional religion believers ask special favors of God. Spinoza proposes instead that we should understand what God wants\\nand we can do so in one way above all - by studying everything that is. By\\nreasoning we can exceed to a divine eternal\\nperspective. Spinoza made a famous distinction\\nbetween two ways of looking at life.   We can either see it egoistically from our\\nlimited point of view. As he put it: sub specie durationis (under the aspect of time) or we can look at things globally\\nand eternally: sub specie aeternitatis (under the\\naspect of eternity). Our nature means that we\\'ll always be\\ndivided between the two. Sensual life pulls us towards a time-bound\\npartial view. But our reason and intelligence can give us\\nunique access to another perspective. It can quite literally allow us - and\\nhere Spinoza becomes beautifully lyrical - to participate in eternal totality. Normally we call bad, whatever is bad\\nfor us, and good whatever increases our power and\\nadvantage. But for Spinoza, to be truly ethical means rising above\\nsuch local concerns. It might all sound forbidding, but\\nSpinoza envisaged his philosophy as a route to a life based on freedom\\nfrom guilt, from sorrow, from pity or from shame. Happiness involves aligning our will with\\nthat of the universe. The Universe God has its own projects\\nand it\\'s our task to understand rather than rail against\\nthese. The free person is one conscious of the\\nnecessities that compel us all. Spinoza writes, the wise man, the person\\nwho understands how and why things are, possesses eternally true complacency\\nof spirit. Needless to say these ideas got Spinoza\\ninto a very deep trouble. He was excommunicated\\nfrom the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1656 The rabbis issued a censure known as \\'cherem\\' against the philosopher. It went by the\\ndecree of the angels and by the commander of the holy man - \\nwe excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Brauch Spinoza with all the\\ncurses which are written in the book of law cursed he be by day and cursed be he\\nby night. Cursed be he when he lies down and cursed be he when he rises up. Spinoza\\nwas forced to flee Amsterdam and eventually settled in The Hague,\\nwhere he lived quietly and peacefully as a lens grinder, and private tutor till his death in 1677.\\nSpinoza\\'s work was largely forgotten down the ages. Hegel took an interest, as did Wittgenstein\\nand several other twentieth century philosophers. But from many perspectives Spinoza\\'s\\nwork constitutes a warning about failures of philosophy. The ethics\\nis one of the world\\'s most beautiful books. It contains a calming perspective for\\nstoring take on life. It replaces the God of superstition with\\na wise and consoling pantheism. And yet Spinoza\\'s work failed utterly to\\nconvince any but a few to abandon traditional religion and to\\nmove towards a rationalist, wise system of belief. The reasons are in a way simple and banal. Spinoza failed to\\nunderstand, like so many philosophers before and\\nsince, that what leads people to religion isn\\'t just reason, but far more importantly: emotion, belief,\\nfear and tradition. People stick with their beliefs\\nbecause they like the ritual, the communal meals, the yearly traditions, the beautiful\\narchitecture, the music and the lovely language read out in a sinagoge or\\nchurch. Spinoza\\'s Ethics arguably contains a\\nwhole lot more wisdom than the Bible. But because it comes without any of the Bible\\'s\\nsupporting structure it remains a marginal work, studied here\\nand there at universities in the West. What the\\ntraditional religion, that Spinoza thought outmoded in the 1670s, continues to thrive and convince people. If we\\'re ever to replace traditional beliefs, we\\nmust remember just how much religion has helped along by ritual, tradition, art and a desire to\\nbelong. All things that Spinoza, despite its\\ngreat wisdom, ignored it as peril in his bold attempt'], 'titles': ['PHILOSOPHY - Aristotle_captions.txt', 'PHILOSOPHY - The Stoics_captions.txt', 'PHILOSOPHY - Baruch Spinoza_captions.txt']}}>\n"

aphorism should be written in large letters in the departure lounges of all the world airports Pascal's charm lies in his bitterness and cynicism people will do anything rather than consider their dreadful reality he thinks man is so vain that the slightest thing like pushing a ball with a billiard cue is enough to divert him at the same time for Pascal people are tortured by their passions especially the passion for fame we are so presumptuous that we want to be known all over the world even by people who will only come after we have gone and perhaps the greatest source of suffering is the most banal boredom we struggle against obstacles but once they are overcome rest proves intolerable because of the boredom it produces Pascal's bitter conclusion what is man are nothing compared to the infinite Pascal misses no opportunities to confront his readers with evidence of mankind's resolutely deviant pitiful and unworthy nature in constantly seductive classical French he informs us that happiness is an illusion anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself that misery is the norm if our condition were truly happy we shouldn't need to divert ourselves from thinking about it the true love is a chimera how hollow and foul is the heart of man that we are as thin-skinned as we are vain a trifle consoles us because of trifle upsets us that even the strongest among us are rendered helpless by the countless diseases to which we're vulnerable flies are so mighty that they can paralyze our minds and eat up our bodies that all worldly institutions are corrupt nothing is surer than that people will be weak and finally that we are absurdly prone to overestimate our own importance how many kingdoms know nothing of us the very best we may hope to do in these circumstances Pascal suggests is to face the desperate facts of our situation head-on man's greatness comes from knowing he is wretched given the tone it comes as a real surprise to discover that reading Pascal is not at all the depressing experience one might have presumed the work is consoling heartwarming and even at times pretty hilarious for those teetering on the verge of despair there can paradoxically be no finer book to turn to than one which seeks to grind man's every last hope into the dust the posse far more than any saccharine volume touting inner beauty positive thinking or the realization of hidden potential has the power to coax the suicidal of the ledge of a high parapet if Pascal's pessimism can so effectively console us it's because we usually cast into gloom not so much by negativity as by hope it's hope with regard to our careers our love lives our children our politicians our planet that's primarily to blame for angering and then embittering us the incompatibility between the size of our aspirations and the mean reality of our condition generates the violent disappointments which torture our days and etch themselves in lines of acrimony across our faces we should honor Pascal and the long line of Christian pessimists to which he belongs for doing is the great favor of publicly and elegantly rehearsing the facts of our rather sinful and pitiful state reading Pascal reminds us that the secular are at this moment in history a great deal more optimistic than the religious something of an irony given the frequency with which the latter have been derided by the former for their apparent naivety it's the secular whose longing for perfection has grown so intense as to lead them to imagine that paradise might we realize on this earth after just a few more years of financial growth and medical research with no evident awareness of the contradiction they may in the same breath gruffly dismiss a belief in angels while sincerely trusting that the combined powers of the IMF the Medical Research Establishment Silicon Valley and democratic politics will together cure the ills of mankind religions have wisely insisted that we are inherently flawed creatures incapable of lasting happiness beset by troubling desires obsessed by status vulnerable to appalling accidents and always heading for death why should any of this be so cheering perhaps because pessimistic exaggeration is so comforting whatever our private disappointments we can start to feel very fortunate when we compare our mood to pascals Pascal wanted to turn us to God by telling us how awful life was but by sharing his pessimistic analyses he ironically strengthens us to face the trouble of our own lives on this earth with greater courage forbearance and occasional humor you\", \"Title: Eastern Vs Western Ideas of Happiness the western intellectual tradition suggests that in order to be happy what we need to do most of all is to go out and subdue the world secure resources found businesses run governments gain fame and conquer nations by contrast the eastern tradition has for a long while told us something very different in both its buddhist and hindu strands it has insisted that contentment requires us to learn to conquer not the world but the instrument through which we view this world namely our minds it won't matter says the east how lustrous and perfect our achievements end up being how much money we accumulate how many friends we acquire so long as our minds remain open to being troubled at any point by our emotional faculties all the benefits of a palace with seven reflecting pools and gardens planted with almond and cherry trees will be wiped out by a depression chronic anxiety will spoil the ownership of the fastest jet a fortune is of no use at all so long as one is nagged by paranoia an unhappy relationship at once destroys any advantages of an esteemed name given this vulnerability of external goods to the vagaries of the mental realm the eastern tradition advises us to stop spending our time trying to rearrange the material building blocks of existence only then to fall foul of psychological ills and to focus instead on learning how to control and manage the inherently unruly and hugely complicated instrument through which the external world reaches consciousness rather than striving to build empires we need to spend many years examining how we think and dream we have to reflect on our families the economic systems we were brought up under the impact of our sexual urges and the biological and cosmological order of nature of which we are an infinitesimal part we have to learn how to breathe in such a way as to allow maximal oxygen to reach our frontal cortex and to hold our bodies so that our organs are not crushed and our blood flow subtly impeded we need to be able to sleep a regular number of hours and remove all distractions and excitements that might disturb our streams of thought this is by no means an easy set of priorities it is indeed as much hard work as managing a law firm but the yogis and sages advise that it delivers us a far more secure hold on the actual ingredients of contentment than the bank account of a newly installed ceo with a yacht of barbuda some of the reason why this continues to feel unreal is that we simply can't imagine that success great wealth and a palace wouldn't in the end do the trick and that in turn is because too few people who have been blessed with such accoutrements have ever given us an honest account of what it felt like to have them intellectual history with its dire incantations against a worldly life has been written by a set of suspiciously poor and envious sounding people it is therefore highly fortuitous and extremely reassuring that buddhism should have been founded by a disgruntled former playboy siddhartha gatama who once had a palace and a trust fund fame and servants but gave them up to sit under a bodhi tree and could therefore tell us with the benefit of lived experience what material goods can really do and not do for us and without false modesty he insisted that they won't be enough the food may be tasty and the room's elegant but such advantages cannot serve their purpose so long as one's mind is haunted and unsteady as it invariably will be without a long emotional education and regular spiritual practice we should take the east's warning seriously however hard we strive it is logical that we can only be as happy as our minds are at peace and given how vulnerable we are to mental disturbances and how short our lives are we should on balance almost certainly spend a little more time on our psyches and a little less time on our plans for a second home and a new york

money, capitalism, and our runaway consumer societies Epicurus was an Ancient Greek born in 341 BC. What made him famous was that he spent all his life trying to work out the largest puzzle there is: what makes people happy? Philosophers before him had discussed at length what could make people good Epicurus preferred to look at what is fun Unfortunately, the world was bitter and bitchy even then and when people heard that Epicurus had set up a school to study happiness the rumors went off the scale There were tales that the school hosted ten course feasts, and orgies every night Epicurus was said, by one critic, to have orgasmed 18 times in a single evening in a bed full of virgins It wasn't true Epicurus and his team were studying happiness, but they were doing it very soberly The philosopher owned only two cloaks, and lived on bread, olives, and for a treat, an occasional slice of cheese As for the bedroom, he merely responded demurely that he'd married philosophy Having patiently studied happiness for many years Epicurus came to a set of remarkable and revolutionary conclusions about what we actually need to be happy He proposed that we typically make 3 mistakes when thinking about happiness: Firstly, we think happiness means having romantic, sexual relationships but Epicurus looked around and saw so many unhappy couples their unions marred by jealousy, misunderstanding, cheating, and bitterness at the same time, he observed how much nicer friendships are: How people tend to be so decent and unpossessive with their friends Friendship seemed to be where human nature was at its sweetest The only problem Epicurus noted was that we don't see our friends enough The next thing we ordinary think that we need to be happy is a lot of money but we tend not properly to factually the unbelievable sacraficies we gotta have to make to get this money: The jealousy, the backbiting, the long hours What makes work really satisfying, Epicurus believed, ins't money but it was able to work alone, or in small groups, like in a bakery, or boat repair shop and when we feel we helping others in our own, minor way improving the world Isn't really large sums or status that we want deep down Its a sense of making a diference and lastely Epicurus observes how obsessive we are with luxury especially involving houses and beautiful serene locations but beneath our love of luxury there is really something else we trying to get out What we want is a feeling of calm We want our minds pure, free... Not full of the normal boredom and chaos But the great question is: Does luxury actually make us calm? Epicurus wasn't so sure... Having looked happiness in depth Epicurus anounces a revolution reset of insights That we really need only three things to be happy in this life Firstly You need your friends around No sex, no orgy, just your mates Enough of seen them only now and then Its regularity of contact that counts So he did that thing that most of us ocasionally dream of doing but never actualy get around do He bought a big house and start living with all his friends Everyone had your own quarters and there was pleasant share areas too There's always someone nice to talk to you in the kitchen Secondly Everyone downshifted All the members of the comune stop working for other people They took big pay cuts in return for doing their own stuff some farming, some cooking, some potring or writing And thirdly Epicurus and his friends stop thinking you could be calm just by having a beautiful view to look out to They devote themselfes to finding calm in their own minds To spending time on their own, reflecting, writing stuff down, reading things, meditating The experiment was so successful, the members of the comune so happy the idea spread like wildfire Epicurean communities open up all around the mediterranean at height of the movement there was four hundred thousand people living in comunes from Spain to Palestine It was only the christian church that ending things in the fifth century But in most of the respect to the community somehow cause they converted all in to monasteries what we know as monasteries are really just epicurean comunes with a christian top soil Another interesting fact: Karl Marx it's Ph.D thesis on Epicurus and what we call communism, a gigantic failed system it's really a grown up, corrupted, not very successful version of epicureanism The real Legacy of Epicurus is that human beings aren't very good make themselves happy especially because they think it's so easy We think we know, it's about sex, money, luxury We just want to how to secure all this but no, says Epicurus Reflect on the moments that truly bring you happiness and they are to do with this Have the courage to change your life, in accordance with the moments that actually delivery satisfaction You might end up living in a very different way Out in the country with just some cheese, a couple of clothes, a few philosophy books and some very good friends down the corridor\"], 'titles': ['PHILOSOPHY - Blaise Pascal_captions.txt', 'Eastern Vs Western Ideas of Happiness_captions.txt', 'PHILOSOPHY - Epicurus_captions.txt']}}>\n",

money, capitalism, and our runaway consumer societies Epicurus was an Ancient Greek born in 341 BC. What made him famous was that he spent all his life trying to work out the largest puzzle there is: what makes people happy? Philosophers before him had discussed at length what could make people good Epicurus preferred to look at what is fun Unfortunately, the world was bitter and bitchy even then and when people heard that Epicurus had set up a school to study happiness the rumors went off the scale There were tales that the school hosted ten course feasts, and orgies every night Epicurus was said, by one critic, to have orgasmed 18 times in a single evening in a bed full of virgins It wasn't true Epicurus and his team were studying happiness, but they were doing it very soberly The philosopher owned only two cloaks, and lived on bread, olives, and for a treat, an occasional slice of cheese As for the bedroom, he merely responded demurely that he'd married philosophy Having patiently studied happiness for many years Epicurus came to a set of remarkable and revolutionary conclusions about what we actually need to be happy He proposed that we typically make 3 mistakes when thinking about happiness: Firstly, we think happiness means having romantic, sexual relationships but Epicurus looked around and saw so many unhappy couples their unions marred by jealousy, misunderstanding, cheating, and bitterness at the same time, he observed how much nicer friendships are: How people tend to be so decent and unpossessive with their friends Friendship seemed to be where human nature was at its sweetest The only problem Epicurus noted was that we don't see our friends enough The next thing we ordinary think that we need to be happy is a lot of money but we tend not properly to factually the unbelievable sacraficies we gotta have to make to get this money: The jealousy, the backbiting, the long hours What makes work really satisfying, Epicurus believed, ins't money but it was able to work alone, or in small groups, like in a bakery, or boat repair shop and when we feel we helping others in our own, minor way improving the world Isn't really large sums or status that we want deep down Its a sense of making a diference and lastely Epicurus observes how obsessive we are with luxury especially involving houses and beautiful serene locations but beneath our love of luxury there is really something else we trying to get out What we want is a feeling of calm We want our minds pure, free... Not full of the normal boredom and chaos But the great question is: Does luxury actually make us calm? Epicurus wasn't so sure... Having looked happiness in depth Epicurus anounces a revolution reset of insights That we really need only three things to be happy in this life Firstly You need your friends around No sex, no orgy, just your mates Enough of seen them only now and then Its regularity of contact that counts So he did that thing that most of us ocasionally dream of doing but never actualy get around do He bought a big house and start living with all his friends Everyone had your own quarters and there was pleasant share areas too There's always someone nice to talk to you in the kitchen Secondly Everyone downshifted All the members of the comune stop working for other people They took big pay cuts in return for doing their own stuff some farming, some cooking, some potring or writing And thirdly Epicurus and his friends stop thinking you could be calm just by having a beautiful view to look out to They devote themselfes to finding calm in their own minds To spending time on their own, reflecting, writing stuff down, reading things, meditating The experiment was so successful, the members of the comune so happy the idea spread like wildfire Epicurean communities open up all around the mediterranean at height of the movement there was four hundred thousand people living in comunes from Spain to Palestine It was only the christian church that ending things in the fifth century But in most of the respect to the community somehow cause they converted all in to monasteries what we know as monasteries are really just epicurean comunes with a christian top soil Another interesting fact: Karl Marx it's Ph.D thesis on Epicurus and what we call communism, a gigantic failed system it's really a grown up, corrupted, not very successful version of epicureanism The real Legacy of Epicurus is that human beings aren't very good make themselves happy especially because they think it's so easy We think we know, it's about sex, money, luxury We just want to how to secure all this but no, says Epicurus Reflect on the moments that truly bring you happiness and they are to do with this Have the courage to change your life, in accordance with the moments that actually delivery satisfaction You might end up living in a very different way Out in the country with just some cheese, a couple of clothes, a few philosophy books and some very good friends down the corridor\"], 'titles': ['PHILOSOPHY - Blaise Pascal_captions.txt', 'Eastern Vs Western Ideas of Happiness_captions.txt', 'PHILOSOPHY - Epicurus_captions.txt']}}>\n",

Philosophers before him had discussed at length what could make people good Epicurus preferred to look at what is fun Unfortunately, the world was bitter and bitchy even then and when people heard that Epicurus had set up a school to study happiness the rumors went off the scale There were tales that the school hosted ten course feasts, and orgies every night Epicurus was said, by one critic, to have orgasmed 18 times in a single evening in a bed full of virgins It wasn't true Epicurus and his team were studying happiness, but they were doing it very soberly The philosopher owned only two cloaks, and lived on bread, olives, and for a treat, an occasional slice of cheese As for the bedroom, he merely responded demurely that he'd married philosophy Having patiently studied happiness for many years Epicurus came to a set of remarkable and revolutionary conclusions about what we actually need to be happy He proposed that we typically make 3 mistakes when thinking about happiness: Firstly, we think happiness means having romantic, sexual relationships but Epicurus looked around and saw so many unhappy couples their unions marred by jealousy, misunderstanding, cheating, and bitterness at the same time, he observed how much nicer friendships are: How people tend to be so decent and unpossessive with their friends Friendship seemed to be where human nature was at its sweetest The only problem Epicurus noted was that we don't see our friends enough The next thing we ordinary think that we need to be happy is a lot of money but we tend not properly to factually the unbelievable sacraficies we gotta have to make to get this money: The jealousy, the backbiting, the long hours What makes work really satisfying, Epicurus believed, ins't money but it was able to work alone, or in small groups, like in a bakery, or boat repair shop and when we feel we helping others in our own, minor way improving the world Isn't really large sums or status that we want deep down Its a sense of making a diference and lastely Epicurus observes how obsessive we are with luxury especially involving houses and beautiful serene locations but beneath our love of luxury there is really something else we trying to get out What we want is a feeling of calm We want our minds pure, free...

is essentially a pleasant process in which happiness is no Mirage and human fulfillment a real possibility however we need only read a few pages of the book known as the posse by the great French 17th century philosopher Blaise Pascal to appreciate how entirely misguided this approach must be because Pascal pulls off the feat of being both one of the most pessimistic figures in Western thought and simultaneously one of the most cheering the combination seems typical the darkest thinkers can paradoxically often be the ones who best lift our mood Pascal was born in Havana in central France in June 1623 and from the earliest days learn to look at the glass of life as half-empty his mother died when he was three he had few friends he was a hunchback and he was always ill luckily he was recognized from an early age and by more than just his proud family to be a genius by 12 he'd worked out the first 32 propositions of Euclid he went on to invent the mathematics of probability he measured atmospheric pressure constructed a calculating machine and designed Paris's first omnibus then at the age of 36 ill-health forced him to set aside plans for further scientific exploration and led him to write a brilliant intensely pessimistic series of aphorisms in defense of Christian belief which became known as the posse the book for which we today chiefly remember and revere him the purpose of the book was to convert readers to God and Pascal felt the best way to do this was to evoke everything that was terrible about life having fully considered the misery of the human condition he assumed his readers would then instantly turn for salvation to the Catholic Church unfortunately for Pascal a very few modern readers now follow the posse alike this the first part of the book listing what's wrong with life has always proved far more popular than the second which suggests what's so right with God Pascal begins by telling us that earthly happiness is an illusion but he's especially keen to point out how much we hate being on our own thinking and exploring our own condition Pascal is perhaps best known for this aphorism of genius two lamellar art is on yong-joon soul Shaw's hidden opacifier demoiii or hope or dodging sharm all of man's unhappiness comes from his inability to stay peacefully alone in his room this aphorism should be written in large letters in the departure lounges of all the world airports Pascal's charm lies in his bitterness and cynicism people will do anything rather than consider their dreadful reality he thinks man is so vain that the slightest thing like pushing a ball with a billiard cue is enough to divert him at the same time for Pascal people are tortured by their passions especially the passion for fame we are so presumptuous that we want to be known all over the world even by people who will only come after we have gone and perhaps the greatest source of suffering is the most banal boredom we struggle against obstacles but once they are overcome rest proves intolerable because of the boredom it produces Pascal's bitter conclusion what is man are nothing compared to the infinite Pascal misses no opportunities to confront his readers with evidence of mankind's resolutely deviant pitiful and unworthy nature in constantly seductive classical French he informs us that happiness is an illusion anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself that misery is the norm if our condition were truly happy we shouldn't need to divert ourselves from thinking about it the true love is a chimera how hollow and foul is the heart of man that we are as thin-skinned as we are vain a trifle consoles us because of trifle upsets us that even the strongest among us are rendered helpless by the countless diseases to which we're vulnerable flies are so mighty that they can paralyze our minds and eat up our bodies that all worldly institutions are corrupt nothing is surer than that people will be weak and finally that we are absurdly prone to overestimate our own importance how many kingdoms know nothing of us the very best we may hope to do in these circumstances Pascal suggests is to face the desperate facts of our situation head-on man's greatness comes from knowing he is wretched given the tone it comes as a real surprise to discover that reading Pascal is not at all the depressing experience one might have presumed the work is consoling heartwarming and even at times pretty hilarious for those teetering on the verge of despair there can paradoxically be no finer book to turn to than one which seeks to grind man's every last hope into the dust the posse far more than any saccharine volume touting inner beauty positive thinking or the realization of hidden potential has the power to coax the suicidal of the ledge of a high parapet if Pascal's pessimism can so effectively console us it's because we usually cast into gloom not so much by negativity as by hope it's hope with regard to our careers our love lives our children our politicians our planet that's primarily to blame for angering and then embittering us the incompatibility between the size of our aspirations and the mean reality of our condition generates the violent disappointments which torture our days and etch themselves in lines of acrimony across our faces we should honor Pascal and the long line of Christian pessimists to which he belongs for doing is the great favor of publicly and elegantly rehearsing the facts of our rather sinful and pitiful state reading Pascal reminds us that the secular are at this moment in history a great deal more optimistic than the religious something of an irony given the frequency with which the latter have been derided by the former for their apparent naivety it's the secular whose longing for perfection has grown so intense as to lead them to imagine that paradise might we realize on this earth after just a few more years of financial growth and medical research with no evident awareness of the contradiction they may in the same breath gruffly dismiss a belief in angels while sincerely trusting that the combined powers of the IMF the Medical Research Establishment Silicon Valley and democratic politics will together cure the ills of mankind religions have wisely insisted that we are inherently flawed creatures incapable of lasting happiness beset by troubling desires obsessed by status vulnerable to appalling accidents and always heading for death why should any of this be so cheering perhaps because pessimistic exaggeration is so comforting whatever our private disappointments we can start to feel very fortunate when we compare our mood to pascals Pascal wanted to turn us to God by telling us how awful life was but by sharing his

Aristotle Aristotle was born around 384 BC in the ancient\\nGreek kingdom of Macedonia where his father was the royal doctor.\\nHe grew up to be arguably the most influential philosopher ever, with modest nicknames like\\n‘the master’ and simply ‘the philosopher’. His first big job was tutoring Alexander the\\nGreat who, soon after, went out and conquered the known world Aristotle then headed off to Athens, worked\\nwith Plato for a bit, then branched out on his own. He founded a little school called\\nthe Lyceum. French secondary schools - ‘the lycees’ - are named in honour of this venture.\\nHe liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas. His followers were nicknamed ‘peripatetics’\\n- ‘the wanderers.’ His many books are actually lecture\\nnotes Aristotle was fascinated by how many things actually work: how does a chick grow in an\\negg? How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place and hardly at all in another? And - most\\nimportantly - what makes a human life, and a whole society, go well?\\nFor Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom.\\nHere are four big philosophical questions he answered.\\nOne : what makes people happy? In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book\\ngot it’s name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the\\ntask of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life - or not. He suggested that good and successful people\\nall possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed that we should get better at identifying what\\nthese are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle\\nzeroed in on 11 virtues Courage\\nFriendliness Modesty Aristotle also observed that every virtue\\nseems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’\\n[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between two extremes of character.\\nFor example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:\\nwit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle looks at ways people are better or worse at\\nconversation. (knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the ingredients of\\nthe good life, Aristotle recognised). Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle\\nsense of humour: that’s the “boor”, someone “useless for any kind of social\\nintercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything.’ But others carry humour to excess: ‘The\\nbuffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself, nor anybody else provided that he\\ncan raise a laugh, and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying.’ So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden\\nmean in this area: witty, but tactful. A particularly fascinating moment is when\\nAristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’ ‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around\\nthe whole host of virtues. We can’t change our behaviour in any of\\nthese areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’\\nsays Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’. It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,\\nAristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.\\nWhat they need is not scolding or being thrown in prison but better teachers, more guidance. Two: what is art for? The blockbuster art at that time was tragedy.\\nAthenians watched gory plays at community festivals in huge open air theatres. Aeschylus,\\nEuripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a ‘how to write great plays’\\nmanual: the Poetics. It’s packed with great tips.\\nFor example, make sure to use: peripeteia - a change in fortune, when for\\nthe hero things go from great to awful [in Titanic, Leonardo de Caprio gets Kate Winslow\\n(great) then they hit the iceberg (awful) and\\nanagnoresis - a moment of dramatic revelation when suddenly the hero works out their life\\nis a catastrophe But what is tragedy actually for? What is the point of a whole community coming together\\nto watch horrible things happening to the lead characters? Like Oedipus (in the play\\nby Sophocles) who by accident, kills his father, gets married to his mother, finds out he’s\\ndone these things [on screen: anagnoresis!) and gouges out his own eyes in remorse and\\ndespair. Aristotle’s answer is Katharis - which is\\ngreek for … Catharsis. Catharsis is a kind of cleaning - you get rid of bad stuff. In this case cleaning up\\nour emotions, specifically our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity.\\nWe’ve got natural problems here: we are hard hearted: we don’t give pity where it\\nis deserved. And we’re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough Tragedy reminds us that:\\nterrible things can befall decent people including ourselves): a small flaw can lead to a whole\\nwe should have more compassion (or pity) for those whose actions go disastrously wrong.\\nWe need to be collective re-taught these crucial truths on a regular basis. The task of art\\n- as Aristotle saw it - is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.\\nThree: What are friends for? In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean\\nEthics Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship.\\nThere’s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun; their ‘chief\\ninterest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment’ which the other\\nperson provides. We need other people to have a nice time around. We need pleasant companions. [on screen, beer drinking festival]\\nThen there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances: ‘they take pleasure\\nin each other’s company only in so far as they have hopes of advantage of it.’ [on screen: faux-jovial business meeting]\\nThen there’s the true friend: Not someone who’s just like you. But someone who isn’t\\nyou - but about whom you care as much as you are about yourself.\\nThe sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows to, their joys are yours. It makes you more\\nvulnerable - should anything befall this person. But it is hugely strengthening: you are relieved\\nfrom the too small orbit of your own thoughts and worries, you expand into the life of another,\\ntogether you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair minded. You share virtues\\nand cancel out each other’s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be. It is - quite\\nliterally - the best part of life. Four: how can ideas cut through in a busy\\nworld? Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck\\nby the fact that the best argument doesn’t always win the debate or the battle. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations:\\nin Athens lots of decisions were made in public meetings (often in the Agora - the town square);\\norators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion. Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals\\nare influenced by many factors that don’t strictly engage with logic or the facts of\\nthe case. It’s maddening. And many serious people\\n[especially Plato] can’t stand it. They avoid the marketplace and populist debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented\\nthe art of what we still today call Rhetoric: the art of getting people to agree with you.\\nHe wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive - to\\nreach those who don’t agree already. He makes some timeless points: You have to\\nrecognise, acknowledge and sooth people’s fears. You have to see the emotional side\\nof the issue - is someone’s pride on the line, are they feeling embarrassed - and edge\\nround it accordingly. You have to make it funny - because attention\\nspans are short. And you might have to use illustrations and\\nexamples to make your point come alive. We’re keen students of Aristotle.\\nToday ‘Philosophy’ doesn’t sound like the most practical activity. Maybe that’s\\nbecause we’ve not paid enough attention, recently, to Aristotle', 'Title: PLATO ON: The Allegory of the Cave The ancient Greeks were emphatic that philosophy was not just an elaborate abstract exercise. It was, they felt, a deeply useful skill that should be learned and practiced by all, in order to help us to live and die well. No one believed this more than Plato. Who was passionate in his defense of philosophy as a kind of therapy for the soul. One of the most forceful stories he told on behalf of the utility of philosophy Was what has become known as \"The Allegory of the Cave\". It is perhaps the most famous allegory in philosophy. This was a story that was intended, as he wrote, to compare \"[t]he effect of education and the lack of it on our nature.\" At the start of Book 7 of his masterpiece, \"The Republic\", Plato tells us about some people living imprisoned in a cave They\\'ve always lived there and don\\'t know anything of the outside world. There is no natural light in this cave, the walls are damp and dark All the inhabitants can see comes from the shadows of things thrown up on the wall by a light of a fire The cave dwellers get fascinated by these reflections of animals, plants and people Moreover, they assume that these shadows are real and that if you pay a lot of attention to them you\\'ll understand and succeed in life And they don\\'t, of course, realize that they are looking at mere phantoms They chat about shadowy things enthusiastically and take great pride in their sophistication and wisdom Then one day, quite by chance, someone discovers a way out of the cave out into the open air At first, it\\'s simply overwhelming. He is dazzled by the brilliant sunshine In which everything is, for the first time, properly illuminated Gradually his eyes adjust and he encounters the true forms of all those things which he had formerly know only as shadows He sees actual flowers, the colors of birds, the nuances in the bark of trees He observes stars and grasps the vastness and sublime nature of the universe As Plato puts it in solemn terms: Out of compassion, this newly enlightened man decides to leave the sunlit upper world and makes his way back into the cave to try to help out his companions who are still mired in confusion and error Because he\\'s become used to the bright upper world, he can hardly see anything underground He stumbles along the damp wet corridors and gets confused He seems to the others totally unimpressive When he in turn is unimpressed by them and insists on explaining what the sun is or what a real tree is like The cave dwellers get sarcastic, then very angry and eventually plot to kill him The story of the cave is an allegory of the life of all enlightened people The cave dwellers are humans before philosophy The sun is the light of reason The alienation of the returned philosopher is what all truth tellers can expect when they take their knowledge back to people who have not devoted themselves to thinking For Plato, we are all for much of our lives in shadow Many of the things we get excited about, like fame, the perfect partner, a high status job are infinetly less real than we suppose they are for the most part phantoms projected by our culture onto the walls of our fragile and flawed minds but because everyone around us is insisting that they are genuine we are taken in from a young age It\\'s not our fault individually No one chooses to be in the cave That\\'s just where we happen to begin We\\'re all starting from a very difficult place If, like the man in Plato\\'s story, you bluntly tell people they\\'re wrong You get nowhere, you cause deep offense and may endanger your own life Athens had, after all, recently put Socrates, Plato\\'s friend, to death Plato knew from close experience just what the cave dwellers might do to those who claim to know the sun The solution, Plato says, is a process of widespread carefully administered philosophical education By which he understood the method of inquiry pioneered by Socrates and known to us as the \"Socratic Method\" It\\'s a very gentle process.

Aristotle Aristotle was born around 384 BC in the ancient\\nGreek kingdom of Macedonia where his father was the royal doctor.\\nHe grew up to be arguably the most influential philosopher ever, with modest nicknames like\\n‘the master’ and simply ‘the philosopher’. His first big job was tutoring Alexander the\\nGreat who, soon after, went out and conquered the known world Aristotle then headed off to Athens, worked\\nwith Plato for a bit, then branched out on his own. He founded a little school called\\nthe Lyceum. French secondary schools - ‘the lycees’ - are named in honour of this venture.\\nHe liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas. His followers were nicknamed ‘peripatetics’\\n- ‘the wanderers.’ His many books are actually lecture\\nnotes Aristotle was fascinated by how many things actually work: how does a chick grow in an\\negg? How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place and hardly at all in another? And - most\\nimportantly - what makes a human life, and a whole society, go well?\\nFor Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom.\\nHere are four big philosophical questions he answered.\\nOne : what makes people happy? In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book\\ngot it’s name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the\\ntask of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life - or not. He suggested that good and successful people\\nall possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed that we should get better at identifying what\\nthese are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle\\nzeroed in on 11 virtues Courage\\nFriendliness Modesty Aristotle also observed that every virtue\\nseems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’\\n[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between two extremes of character.\\nFor example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:\\nwit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle looks at ways people are better or worse at\\nconversation. (knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the ingredients of\\nthe good life, Aristotle recognised). Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle\\nsense of humour: that’s the “boor”, someone “useless for any kind of social\\nintercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything.’ But others carry humour to excess: ‘The\\nbuffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself, nor anybody else provided that he\\ncan raise a laugh, and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying.’ So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden\\nmean in this area: witty, but tactful. A particularly fascinating moment is when\\nAristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’ ‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around\\nthe whole host of virtues. We can’t change our behaviour in any of\\nthese areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’\\nsays Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’. It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,\\nAristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.\\nWhat they need is not scolding or being thrown in prison but better teachers, more guidance. Two: what is art for? The blockbuster art at that time was tragedy.\\nAthenians watched gory plays at community festivals in huge open air theatres. Aeschylus,\\nEuripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a ‘how to write great plays’\\nmanual: the Poetics. It’s packed with great tips.\\nFor example, make sure to use: peripeteia - a change in fortune, when for\\nthe hero things go from great to awful [in Titanic, Leonardo de Caprio gets Kate Winslow\\n(great) then they hit the iceberg (awful) and\\nanagnoresis - a moment of dramatic revelation when suddenly the hero works out their life\\nis a catastrophe But what is tragedy actually for? What is the point of a whole community coming together\\nto watch horrible things happening to the lead characters? Like Oedipus (in the play\\nby Sophocles) who by accident, kills his father, gets married to his mother, finds out he’s\\ndone these things [on screen: anagnoresis!) and gouges out his own eyes in remorse and\\ndespair. Aristotle’s answer is Katharis - which is\\ngreek for … Catharsis. Catharsis is a kind of cleaning - you get rid of bad stuff. In this case cleaning up\\nour emotions, specifically our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity.\\nWe’ve got natural problems here: we are hard hearted: we don’t give pity where it\\nis deserved. And we’re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough Tragedy reminds us that:\\nterrible things can befall decent people including ourselves): a small flaw can lead to a whole\\nwe should have more compassion (or pity) for those whose actions go disastrously wrong.\\nWe need to be collective re-taught these crucial truths on a regular basis.

His first big job was tutoring Alexander the\\nGreat who, soon after, went out and conquered the known world Aristotle then headed off to Athens, worked\\nwith Plato for a bit, then branched out on his own. He founded a little school called\\nthe Lyceum. French secondary schools - ‘the lycees’ - are named in honour of this venture.\\nHe liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas. His followers were nicknamed ‘peripatetics’\\n- ‘the wanderers.’ His many books are actually lecture\\nnotes Aristotle was fascinated by how many things actually work: how does a chick grow in an\\negg? How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place and hardly at all in another? And - most\\nimportantly - what makes a human life, and a whole society, go well?\\nFor Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom.\\nHere are four big philosophical questions he answered.\\nOne : what makes people happy? In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book\\ngot it’s name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the\\ntask of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life - or not. He suggested that good and successful people\\nall possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed that we should get better at identifying what\\nthese are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle\\nzeroed in on 11 virtues Courage\\nFriendliness Modesty Aristotle also observed that every virtue\\nseems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’\\n[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between two extremes of character.\\nFor example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:\\nwit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle looks at ways people are better or worse at\\nconversation. (knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the ingredients of\\nthe good life, Aristotle recognised). Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle\\nsense of humour: that’s the “boor”, someone “useless for any kind of social\\nintercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything.’ But others carry humour to excess: ‘The\\nbuffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself, nor anybody else provided that he\\ncan raise a laugh, and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying.’ So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden\\nmean in this area: witty, but tactful. A particularly fascinating moment is when\\nAristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’ ‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around\\nthe whole host of virtues. We can’t change our behaviour in any of\\nthese areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’\\nsays Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’. It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,\\nAristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.\\nWhat they need is not scolding or being thrown in prison but better teachers, more guidance. Two: what is art for? The blockbuster art at that time was tragedy.\\nAthenians watched gory plays at community festivals in huge open air theatres. Aeschylus,\\nEuripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a ‘how to write great plays’\\nmanual: the Poetics. It’s packed with great tips.\\nFor example, make sure to use: peripeteia - a change in fortune, when for\\nthe hero things go from great to awful [in Titanic, Leonardo de Caprio gets Kate Winslow\\n(great) then they hit the iceberg (awful) and\\nanagnoresis - a moment of dramatic revelation when suddenly the hero works out their life\\nis a catastrophe But what is tragedy actually for? What is the point of a whole community coming together\\nto watch horrible things happening to the lead characters? Like Oedipus (in the play\\nby Sophocles) who by accident, kills his father, gets married to his mother, finds out he’s\\ndone these things [on screen: anagnoresis!) and gouges out his own eyes in remorse and\\ndespair. Aristotle’s answer is Katharis - which is\\ngreek for … Catharsis. Catharsis is a kind of cleaning - you get rid of bad stuff. In this case cleaning up\\nour emotions, specifically our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity.\\nWe’ve got natural problems here: we are hard hearted: we don’t give pity where it\\nis deserved. And we’re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough Tragedy reminds us that:\\nterrible things can befall decent people including ourselves): a small flaw can lead to a whole\\nwe should have more compassion (or pity) for those whose actions go disastrously wrong.\\nWe need to be collective re-taught these crucial truths on a regular basis. The task of art\\n- as Aristotle saw it - is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.\\nThree: What are friends for? In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean\\nEthics Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship.\\nThere’s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun; their ‘chief\\ninterest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment’ which the other\\nperson provides. We need other people to have a nice time around. We need pleasant companions. [on screen, beer drinking festival]\\nThen there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances: ‘they take pleasure\\nin each other’s company only in so far as they have hopes of advantage of it.’ [on screen: faux-jovial business meeting]\\nThen there’s the true friend: Not someone who’s just like you. But someone who isn’t\\nyou - but about whom you care as much as you are about yourself.\\nThe sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows to, their joys are yours. It makes you more\\nvulnerable - should anything befall this person. But it is hugely strengthening: you are relieved\\nfrom the too small orbit of your own thoughts and worries, you expand into the life of another,\\ntogether you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair minded. You share virtues\\nand cancel out each other’s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be. It is - quite\\nliterally - the best part of life. Four: how can ideas cut through in a busy\\nworld? Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck\\nby the fact that the best argument doesn’t always win the debate or the battle. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations:\\nin Athens lots of decisions were made in public meetings (often in the Agora - the town square);\\norators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion. Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals\\nare influenced by many factors that don’t strictly engage with logic or the facts of\\nthe case. It’s maddening. And many serious people\\n[especially Plato] can’t stand it. They avoid the marketplace and populist debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented\\nthe art of what we still today call Rhetoric: the art of getting people to agree with you.\\nHe wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive - to\\nreach those who don’t agree already. He makes some timeless points: You have to\\nrecognise, acknowledge and sooth people’s fears. You have to see the emotional side\\nof the issue - is someone’s pride on the line, are they feeling embarrassed - and edge\\nround it accordingly. You have to make it funny - because attention\\nspans are short. And you might have to use illustrations and\\nexamples to make your point come alive. We’re keen students of Aristotle.\\nToday ‘Philosophy’ doesn’t sound like the most practical activity. Maybe that’s\\nbecause we’ve not paid enough attention, recently, to Aristotle', 'Title: PLATO ON: The Allegory of the Cave The ancient Greeks were emphatic that philosophy was not just an elaborate abstract exercise. It was, they felt, a deeply useful skill that should be learned and practiced by all, in order to help us to live and die well. No one believed this more than Plato. Who was passionate in his defense of philosophy as a kind of therapy for the soul. One of the most forceful stories he told on behalf of the utility of philosophy Was what has become known as \"The Allegory of the Cave\". It is perhaps the most famous allegory in philosophy. This was a story that was intended, as he wrote, to compare \"[t]he effect of education and the lack of it on our nature.\" At the start of Book 7 of his masterpiece, \"The Republic\", Plato tells us about some people living imprisoned in a cave They\\'ve always lived there and don\\'t know anything of the outside world. There is no natural light in this cave, the walls are damp and dark All the inhabitants can see comes from the shadows of things thrown up on the wall by a light of a fire The cave dwellers get fascinated by these reflections of animals, plants and people Moreover, they assume that these shadows are real and that if you pay a lot of attention to them you\\'ll understand and succeed in life And they don\\'t, of course, realize that they are looking at mere phantoms They chat about shadowy things enthusiastically and take great pride in their sophistication and wisdom Then one day, quite by chance, someone discovers a way out of the cave out into the open air At first, it\\'s simply overwhelming. He is dazzled by the brilliant sunshine In which everything is, for the first time, properly illuminated Gradually his eyes adjust and he encounters the true forms of all those things which he had formerly know only as shadows He sees actual flowers, the colors of birds, the nuances in the bark of trees He observes stars and grasps the vastness and sublime nature of the universe As Plato puts it in solemn terms: Out of compassion, this newly enlightened man decides to leave the sunlit upper world and makes his way back into the cave to try to help out his companions who are still mired in confusion and error Because he\\'s become used to the bright upper world, he can hardly see anything underground He stumbles along the damp wet corridors and gets confused He seems to the others totally unimpressive When he in turn is unimpressed by them and insists on explaining what the sun is or what a real tree is like The cave dwellers get sarcastic, then very angry and eventually plot to kill him The story of the cave is an allegory of the life of all enlightened people The cave dwellers are humans before philosophy The sun is the light of reason The alienation of the returned philosopher is what all truth tellers can expect when they take their knowledge back to people who have not devoted themselves to thinking For Plato, we are all for much of our lives in shadow Many of the things we get excited about, like fame, the perfect partner, a high status job are infinetly less real than we suppose they are for the most part phantoms projected by our culture onto the walls of our fragile and flawed minds but because everyone around us is insisting that they are genuine we are taken in from a young age It\\'s not our fault individually No one chooses to be in the cave That\\'s just where we happen to begin We\\'re all starting from a very difficult place If, like the man in Plato\\'s story, you bluntly tell people they\\'re wrong You get nowhere, you cause deep offense and may endanger your own life Athens had, after all, recently put Socrates, Plato\\'s friend, to death Plato knew from close experience just what the cave dwellers might do to those who claim to know the sun The solution, Plato says, is a process of widespread carefully administered philosophical education By which he understood the method of inquiry pioneered by Socrates and known to us as the \"Socratic Method\" It\\'s a very gentle process. You don\\'t lecture or harang or force someone to read a particular book You just start with a general declaration of intellectual modesty no one knows very much It\\'s always good to insist: \"wisdom starts with owning up to ignorance\" Confess that you don\\'t know exactly what the government should do, what wars meant to achieve or how good relationships work You then get the other person to say what they think and gradually together you investigate the answers Most likely the other person will be confident or rather painfully overconfident They may tell you it\\'s all quite simple really and everyone knows the answer already You must be supremely patient with this kind of bravado If they go off topic, you must cheerfully double back You must take a lot of time and be ready to have chats over many days This method of talking is founded on a lovely confidence that with the right encouragement people can eventually work out things for themselves and detect errors in their own reasoning If you carefully and quietly draw their attention to tricky points and don\\'t cast blame or ever get annoyed You\\'ll never teach anyone anything by making them feel stupid Even if they are, at first We have all started in that cave but it is Plato\\'s deepest insight that we don\\'t have to stay there And the road out is called, quite simply, philosophy This is the sun whose light we can follow and by whose rays the proper nature of things can become clear If you enjoyed the films on this channel, you might want to hear about another smart insightful channel we love called Wisecrack Click here to visit their channel page and discover a succession of videos on world literature, philosophy, cinema, history and more All delivered with a playful beguiling sense of humor They\\'re in L.A., we\\'re here in London, but the School of Life and Wisecrack have become firm friends Based around shared values about making education compelling We\\'d love you to befriend us both in turn.'], 'titles': ['PHILOSOPHY - The Stoics_captions.txt', 'PHILOSOPHY - Aristotle_captions.txt', 'PLATO ON: The Allegory of the Cave_captions.txt']}}>\n",

The Stoics this is a film about ism and why you need your life because as people seldom tell you but we will quietly stoicism was a philosophy that flourished for 480 years in ancient Greece and Rome and was popular with everyone from slaves to the aristocracy because unlike so much philosophy it was helpful helping when we panic want to give up despair and rage at existence we still honor this philosophy whenever we think of someone as brave and without perhaps quite knowing why call them stoic there are two great philosophers of stoicism the first is the Roman writer and Tudor to Nero seneca he lived between 84 and 80 65 that's right Tudor to Nero the infamous dictator who slept with his own mother raped young boys and just because he felt like it asked his old tutor Seneca to commit suicide in front of his own family and our other guy - stoicism is the kind and magnanimous Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius 81 to 1 to 180 who was forced to spend most of his reign on the edges of the Empire fighting off invincible Germanic hordes but found time to write one of the greatest works of philosophy the meditations in his tent at night there are two problems stoicism can help us with in particular the first is anxiety when you're feeling anxious about something most people are maddening they believe it's their duty to cheer you up however intelligent they might otherwise be say things like it'll be okay don't worry even cheer up the Stoics were appalled they hated any kind of consolation that aims to give the listener hope hope is the opium of the emotions and must be stamped out conclusively for a person to stand any chance of inner peace but this hope only lifts you up higher for the eventual fall the Stoics advises to take a different path to be calm one has to tell oneself something very dark it will be terrible I might have to go to prison the lump really could be malign I probably will be fired and humiliated my friends almost certainly will succeed but a huge consoling stoic but one must keep in mind that one will nevertheless be ok ok because in the end as Marcus Aurelius said we are each of us stronger than we think prison won't be fun nor will losing one's job or being made a laughingstock but one will get through it stoicism emboldened us against the worst fate can throw at us and if you really really can't take it suicide is always an option the Stoics mentioned this repeatedly here is Seneca can you no longer see a road of freedom it's right in front of you you need only turn over your wrists to build up an impression of one's own resilience the stoic suggested one regularly rehearse worst-case scenarios for example twice a year one should take off on smart clothes get into some dirty rags sleep on a rug in the kitchen floor and eat only stale bread and rainwater from an animal's Bowl and thereby you'll make an amazing discovery as Marcus Aurelius booted almost nothing material is needed for a happy life for he who has understood existence another subject of interest to the Stoics was anger Romans were a bad-tempered lot the stoics wanted to calm them down but they did so by an unusual route by intellectual argument they proposed that getting angry isn't something you do by nature because you have a Latin temper or a somehow inherently hot-blooded it's the result of being stupid of having the wrong ideas about life anger stems when misplaced hope smashes into unforeseen reality we don't shout every time something bad happens to us only when it's bad and unexpected for example you'd never shout just because it started raining even though rain can be horrible because you've learned to expect rain the same should apply to everything don't only expect rain expect betrayal infamy sadism theft humiliation lust greed spite one will stop being so angry when one learns the true facts of the misery of life the wise person should aim to reach a state where simply nothing could suddenly disturb their peace of mind every tragedy should already be priced in we're gonna leave you with the most beautiful remark that Seneca made just as Nero's guards were grabbing him and shoving into a bathroom where he was meant to take a sharp knife and kill himself his wife Polina and two children were panicking weeping clinging to his cloaks the Seneca turned to them pulled a weary smile at them and simply said what need is there to weep over parts of life the whole of it calls for tears we have much to learn from the Stoics you\", 'Title: PHILOSOPHY - Aristotle Aristotle was born around 384 BC in the ancient\\nGreek kingdom of Macedonia where his father was the royal doctor.\\nHe grew up to be arguably the most influential philosopher ever, with modest nicknames like\\n‘the master’ and simply ‘the philosopher’. His first big job was tutoring Alexander the\\nGreat who, soon after, went out and conquered the known world Aristotle then headed off to Athens, worked\\nwith Plato for a bit, then branched out on his own. He founded a little school called\\nthe Lyceum. French secondary schools - ‘the lycees’ - are named in honour of this venture.\\nHe liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas. His followers were nicknamed ‘peripatetics’\\n- ‘the wanderers.’ His many books are actually lecture\\nnotes Aristotle was fascinated by how many things actually work: how does a chick grow in an\\negg? How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place and hardly at all in another? And - most\\nimportantly - what makes a human life, and a whole society, go well?\\nFor Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom.\\nHere are four big philosophical questions he answered.\\nOne : what makes people happy? In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book\\ngot it’s name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the\\ntask of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life - or not. He suggested that good and successful people\\nall possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed that we should get better at identifying what\\nthese are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle\\nzeroed in on 11 virtues Courage\\nFriendliness Modesty Aristotle also observed that every virtue\\nseems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’\\n[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between two extremes of character.\\nFor example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:\\nwit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle looks at ways people are better or worse at\\nconversation. (knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the ingredients of\\nthe good life, Aristotle recognised). Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle\\nsense of humour: that’s the “boor”, someone “useless for any kind of social\\nintercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything.’ But others carry humour to excess: ‘The\\nbuffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself, nor anybody else provided that he\\ncan raise a laugh, and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying.’ So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden\\nmean in this area: witty, but tactful. A particularly fascinating moment is when\\nAristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’ ‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around\\nthe whole host of virtues. We can’t change our behaviour in any of\\nthese areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’\\nsays Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’. It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,\\nAristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.\\nWhat they need is not scolding or being thrown in prison but better teachers, more guidance. Two: what is art for? The blockbuster art at that time was tragedy.\\nAthenians watched gory plays at community festivals in huge open air theatres. Aeschylus,\\nEuripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a ‘how to write great plays’\\nmanual: the Poetics. It’s packed with great tips.\\nFor example, make sure to use: peripeteia - a change in fortune, when for\\nthe hero things go from great to awful [in Titanic, Leonardo de Caprio gets Kate Winslow\\n(great) then they hit the iceberg (awful) and\\nanagnoresis - a moment of dramatic revelation when suddenly the hero works out their life\\nis a catastrophe But what is tragedy actually for? What is the point of a whole community coming together\\nto watch horrible things happening to the lead characters? Like Oedipus (in the play\\nby Sophocles) who by accident, kills his father, gets married to his mother, finds out he’s\\ndone these things [on screen: anagnoresis!) and gouges out his own eyes in remorse and\\ndespair. Aristotle’s answer is Katharis - which is\\ngreek for … Catharsis. Catharsis is a kind of cleaning - you get rid of bad stuff. In this case cleaning up\\nour emotions, specifically our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity.\\nWe’ve got natural problems here: we are hard hearted: we don’t give pity where it\\nis deserved. And we’re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough Tragedy reminds us that:\\nterrible things can befall decent people including ourselves): a small flaw can lead to a whole\\nwe should have more compassion (or pity) for those whose actions go disastrously wrong.\\nWe need to be collective re-taught these crucial truths on a regular basis. The task of art\\n- as Aristotle saw it - is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.\\nThree: What are friends for? In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean\\nEthics Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship.\\nThere’s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun; their ‘chief\\ninterest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment’ which the other\\nperson provides. We need other people to have a nice time around. We need pleasant companions. [on screen, beer drinking festival]\\nThen there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances: ‘they take pleasure\\nin each other’s company only in so far as they have hopes of advantage of it.’ [on screen: faux-jovial business meeting]\\nThen there’s the true friend: Not someone who’s just like you. But someone who isn’t\\nyou - but about whom you care as much as you are about yourself.\\nThe sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows to, their joys are yours. It makes you more\\nvulnerable - should anything befall this person. But it is hugely strengthening: you are relieved\\nfrom the too small orbit of your own thoughts and worries, you expand into the life of another,\\ntogether you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair minded. You share virtues\\nand cancel out each other’s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be. It is - quite\\nliterally - the best part of life. Four: how can ideas cut through in a busy\\nworld? Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck\\nby the fact that the best argument doesn’t always win the debate or the battle. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations:\\nin Athens lots of decisions were made in public meetings (often in the Agora - the town square);\\norators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion. Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals\\nare influenced by many factors that don’t strictly engage with logic or the facts of\\nthe case. It’s maddening. And many serious people\\n[especially Plato] can’t stand it. They avoid the marketplace and populist debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented\\nthe art of what we still today call Rhetoric: the art of getting people to agree with you.\\nHe wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive - to\\nreach those who don’t agree already. He makes some timeless points: You have to\\nrecognise, acknowledge and sooth people’s fears. You have to see the emotional side\\nof the issue - is someone’s pride on the line, are they feeling embarrassed - and edge\\nround it accordingly. You have to make it funny - because attention\\nspans are short. And you might have to use illustrations and\\nexamples to make your point come alive. We’re keen students of Aristotle.\\nToday ‘Philosophy’ doesn’t sound like the most practical activity. Maybe that’s\\nbecause we’ve not paid enough attention, recently, to Aristotle', 'Title: PLATO ON: The Allegory of the Cave The ancient Greeks were emphatic that philosophy was not just an elaborate abstract exercise. It was, they felt, a deeply useful skill that should be learned and practiced by all, in order to help us to live and die well. No one believed this more than Plato. Who was passionate in his defense of philosophy as a kind of therapy for the soul. One of the most forceful stories he told on behalf of the utility of philosophy Was what has become known as \"The Allegory of the Cave\". It is perhaps the most famous allegory in philosophy. This was a story that was intended, as he wrote, to compare \"[t]he effect of education and the lack of it on our nature.\" At the start of Book 7 of his masterpiece, \"The Republic\", Plato tells us about some people living imprisoned in a cave They\\'ve always lived there and don\\'t know anything of the outside world.
